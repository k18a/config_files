Experience and Projects Involved In:-
PhD Researcher, University of Edinburgh, UK, Sep 16 to Present
Project Title: Adsorption and Migration Mechanisms of Methane, Water, and Carbon dioxide in Gas Shales at Pore Scale
Project Description: Nearly 50-80% of total gas stored in gas shales is in the adsorbed state, implying that production from gas shales is heavily dependent on desorption, although very little is known about the mechanisms underlying these processes. This project attempts to rectify that though a series of laboratory experiments, and uses an one dimensional reservoir simulation to test formulated hypotheses.
Achievements:
- Designed, built, and automated an home-made manometric adsorption measurement rig from scratch
- Designed and deployed an highly-scalable modular python programme for data analysis
- Attended courses in Statistical Thermodynamics (Molecular Simulations) and Oil and Gas Engineering

Production Technology Specialist, Schlumberger, India, Jul 15 to Mar 16
Project Title: Control of Hydrogen Sulphide Production from Reservoir and Process Trains
Project Description: Hydrogen Sulphide produced as a by-product of anaerobic metabolism by Sulphate Reducing Bacteria can pose significant challenges to safe and efficient operations on field. This project involved limiting Hydrogen Sulphide Production by 1) limiting Sulphate Reducing Bacteria population accomplished through biocide dosing, 2) bio competitive exclusion by maintaining optimum conditions for Nitrate Reducing Bacteria, and 3) Hydrogen Sulphide removal using a scavenger.

Project Engineer, Arka Energy, India, Jan 15 to Jun 15
Project Title: LNG Import Terminal Feasibility Study
Project Description: There is a significant shortage of Natural Gas in several regions of South India, posing a major hindrance to industrial development in the region. The project produced a Feasibility Study report to install and operate a Liquefied Natural Gas import terminal at the Thirukadayur port, India, that was later submitted to investors.

Masters Dissertation Student, University of Aberdeen, UK, Jul 15 to Sep 14
Project Title: UK Carbon Capture and Storage Policy Analysis
Project Description: Carbon Capture and Storage is one of the proposed methods to reduce the carbon footprint of industrial activities. The dissertation provides an analysis of economic and regulatory policies that maybe deployed to accelerate CCS adoption in the UK.

Process Engineer Trainee, Petro6 EC, India, Dec 12 to Aug 13
Project Title: Design of Early Production Facilities
Project Description: Early Production Facilities can be used to bring cash flow from hydrocarbon production forward, whilst waiting for the installation and commissioning of more permanent facilities on field. The project involved the design of oil and water process trains of an early production facility based on input parameters from an onshore oil field in Barmer, India - conducted as part of undergraduate design project. 

Voluntary and Part-time Experience:-
