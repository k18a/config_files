As detailed in my CV, my professional career and training up to this point has had a singular focus on the application of Chemical Engineering technologies to the energy industry, which happens to be the core activity of ExxonMobil. Just as ExxonMobil, I'm also committed to being a leader in my chosen profession, and will be working towards chartership with the IChemE and the Engineering council after the commencing my graduate position with ExxonMobil. 
3. Value System
I'm fully committed to giving back to the community and making the world a better place through engineering, reflected through my voluntary work as the secretary of the IChemE's Scottish Members Group and through my tutoring and demonstration jobs with Chemical Engineering undergraduates at the university. I hope that I could continue to be an ambassador for Chemical Engineering and other STEM fields alongside ExxonMobil. With safety and integrity being at the core of my personal value system, I'm confident of proving myself a significant asset in ExxonMobil's mission to provide affordable energy to the global market in a safe, effecient, and responsible way.
