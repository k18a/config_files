#+TITLE: Diffusivity

* Diffusivity

* Anisotropic Media
- have different diffusivities in different directions
- cyrstals, textiles, and polymers are examples of anisotropic media
- diffusivity for non-isotropic media
\begin{equation}
F_x = 
D_{xx} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} +
D_{xy} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} +
D_{xz} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z} 

F_y = 
D_{yx} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} +
D_{yy} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} +
D_{yz} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z} 

F_z = 
D_{zx} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} +
D_{zy} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} +
D_{zz} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z} 
\end{equation}
- for example $D_{xz}\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}$ is the contribution to mass transfer in the x direction due to the concentration gradient in the z direction

* Permeability
- ability of a porous material to allow fluids to pass through it
- depends on the porosity, pore shape, and pore-connectedness
- pressure dependent
- measured in terms of darcy
  - $1 darcy \approx 10 ^{-12} m2$
- permability tensor is symmetric, k_{ij} = k_{ji}; is of the form for anisotropic media
\begin{equation}
k = 
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{11} & k_{12} & k_{13} \\
k_{21} & k_{22} & k_{23} \\
k_{31} & k_{32} & k_{33}
\end{bmatrix}
= 
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{xx} & k_{xy} & k_{xz} \\
k_{xy} & k_{yy} & k_{yz} \\
k_{xz} & k_{yz} & k_{zz}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
- permeability tensor for isotropic rocks
\begin{equation}
k = 
\begin{bmatrix}
k_{x} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & k_{x} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & k_{x}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
- permeability is constant for an homogeneous rock, k
- is a proportionality constant in [[file:darcyslaw.org][Darcy's law]]
  
** Hydraulic Conductivity
 - permeability is related to hydraulic conductivity as follows
 \begin{equation}
 K = \frac{k \rho g}{\mu}
 \end{equation}
 - K is hydraulic conductivity
 - k is permeability
 - \rho is density
 - g is acceleration due to gravity
 - \mu is viscosity

* Research
- the use of CO2 based fracturing fluids can minimise reduction in formation permeability due to water imbibition cite:Lu2016
- permeability of shales can increase when treated with CO2-saturated brine solution at hydraulic fracturing conditions due to the decomposition of carbonate minerals cite:Lu2016
