#+TITLE: Freundlich Isotherm

- initially proposed as an empirical approach to model adsorption, can also be derived theoretically based on an adsorption potential approach. 
- does not have proper Henry's law behavior, or a finite limit when pressure is high. 
- can only be applied to a narrow pressure range.
- isotherm
  - $C_ \mu = K * P ^{(1/n)}$
    - parameter n is usually greater than 1
- linear form of equation:
  - $log(C_ {\mu}) = log(K) + \frac{1}{n} log(P)$
  - yields a straight 

* Theoretical Derivation

Assumptions:

1. Heterogeneous surface
2. Adsorption energy is distributed
3. Surface topography is patchwise 
4. Sites having the same adsorption energy are grouped together in one patch 
5. Each patch is independent from the others - no interaction between patches
6. Langmuir isotherm is applicable to each patch
7. Energy distribution of all patches follows exponential decay function
\begin{equation}
F(A) = \delta exp(-A/A_0)
\end{equation}
- where $\delta$ and A0 are constants with the product of aE0 being the total number of sites, and A0 being the characteristic adsorption potential

* Temperature Dependence
- using an adsorption potential approach: 
\begin{equation}
A=R*T*ln(\frac{P}{P_0})
\end{equation}
- temperature dependence of K:
\begin{equation}
K = (\delta A_0) (P_0 ^{\frac{RT}{A_0}})
\end{equation}
- where P0 is the pressure at with saturation occurs and is assumed to be the vapour pressure
- using the [[file:clausiusclapeyron.org][Clausius-Clapeyron equation]]
\begin{equation}
ln P_0 = \alpha - \frac{\beta}{T}
\end{equation}
- the temperature dependence of K is thus given as
\begin{equation}
K=K_0*exp(-\frac{\alpha R T}{A_0})
\end{equation}
- temperature dependence of n:
\begin{equation}
n = \frac{A_0}{R T}
\end{equation}
- this is just adsorption energy A0 over the molar thermal energy RT
- heat of adsorption is given using the [[file:vanthoffequation.org][van't Hoff equation]]
- to get the enthalpy when equilibrium constant is given
\begin{equation}
\Delta H = -R T^2(\frac{\partial ln P}{\partial T})
\end{equation}
- on solving gives
\begin{equation}
\Delta H = -[ln(\delta A_0) + \frac{R \beta}{A_0}]A_0 + A_0 ln(C_\mu)
\end{equation}
