#+TITLE: Linear Subspace
- ${R^n}$ is the set of all posible vectors
- {V} is a subset of ${R^n}$
- to be a subspace of ${R^n}$ a vector {V} needs to satisfy the following conditions
  - {V} contains [0] vector
  - closure under scalar multiplication
    - vector [x[ in {V} times any scalar c is also in {V}
  - closure under addition 
    - if vectors [a] and [b] are in {V}, then [a] + [b] are also in {V}
