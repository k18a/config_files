#+TITLE: Diffusion Equation
- a partial differential equation that describes the collective motion of micro-particles in a material resulting from the random movement of each micro-particle
- same as the Fick's Second Law, but this article deals more with the mathematics of the equation
- is written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \phi (r,t)}{\partial t} = \nabla . [D(\phi, r) \nabla \phi (r,t)]
\end{equation}
- \phi is density of the diffusing material at location r and time t
- D is diffusion coefficeint for density \phi at location r

- when D is a symmetric positive definite matrix, the equation describes anisotropic diffusion, which is written as
le for the understanding of self diffusion mechanism

- also has applications in mathematics: [[file:markovprocess.org][Markov Process]], materials sciences, information sciences, etc

- is derived from the continuity equation also known as the Eulerian [[file:materialtimederivative.org][material balance equation]], combined with [[file:fickslaws.org][Fick's first law]]
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla (j) = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
j = -D (\phi, r) \nabla \phi (r,t)
\end{equation}
- where j is the flux if the diffusing material
* Derivation
- consider the following volume - a rectangular parallepiped with sides 2dx, 2dy, and 2dz
- let concentration at the centre be C

- rate at which diffusing substance enters the control volume is given as
\begin{equation}
4 dy dz (F_x - \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x} dx)
\end{equation}
- rate at which diffusing substance exits the control volume is given as
\begin{equation}
4 dy dz (F_x + \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x} dx)
\end{equation}
- performing mass balance, net accumulation in the x direction is given as
\begin{equation}
-8 dx dy dz \frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x}
\end{equation}
- similarly in y and z directions
\begin{equation}
-8 dx dy dz \frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
-8 dx dy dz \frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
- since average concentration is given as C, the rate at which diffusing amount changes is given as volume * concentration difference
\begin{equation}
8 dx dy dz \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
- equating the above equations
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} +
\frac{\partial F_x}{\partial x} +
\frac{\partial F_y}{\partial y} +
\frac{\partial F_z}{\partial z} = 0
\end{equation}
- substituting Fick's First Law for isotropic media (constant D in all directions)
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D (
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} +
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2} +
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2} )
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D (\nabla^2 C)
\end{equation}
** Non-isotropic media
- if the media is not isotropic
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = \nabla (D . \nabla C)
\end{equation}
- diffusivity for non-isotropic media
\begin{equation}
F_x =
D_{xx} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} +
D_{xy} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} +
D_{xz} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z}

F_y =
D_{yx} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} +
D_{yy} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} +
D_{yz} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z}

F_z =
D_{zx} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} +
D_{zy} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} +
D_{zz} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
- for example $D_{xz}\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}$ is the contribution to mass transfer in the x direction due to the concentration gradient in the z direction
- Substituting Fick's first law into the above equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} =
(D_{xx})
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} ) +
(D_{yy})
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2} ) +
(D_{zz})
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2} ) +
(D_{yz} + D_{zy})
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y \partial z} ) +
(D_{xz} + D_{zx})
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x \partial z} ) +
(D_{xy} + D_{yx})
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x \partial y} ) +
\end{equation}
- consider the transformation that converts an ellipsoid co-ordinates to rectangular co-ordinates
- transforming into rectangular co-ordinates $\epsilon, \eta, \zeta$, giving
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} =
D_{\epsilon}
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial \epsilon^2} ) +
D_{\eta}
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial \eta^2} ) +
D_{\zeta}
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial \zeta^2} ) +
\end{equation}
- performing more transformations to co-ordinates $\epsilon_1, \eta_1, \zeta_1$, giving
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} =
D
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial \epsilon_1^2}  +
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial \eta_1^2}  +
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial \zeta_1^2} )
\end{equation}
- thus problems in anisotropic media can sometimes be reduced to problems in isotrpic media, depending on the boundary conditions of the problem - when the media is infinite or bounded by planes perpendicular to the principal axes of diffusion
- a more general conservation equation that gives change in concentration with time
  - $$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D * \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial r^2} = D (\frac{\partial ^2 C}{\partial z ^2} + \frac{1}{A} + \frac{\partial A}{\partial z} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z})$$
  - t is time
- For a non-linear isotherm cite:Clarkson1999
  - $$\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (D {\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}}) = \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}$$
** In terms of Pressure
- obrained by substituting [[file:darcyslaw.org][Darcy's Law]]
\begin{equation}
Q = -\frac{k}{\mu} (\nabla P - \rho g)
\end{equation}
- and the fact that fluid velocity is given as
\begin{equation}
v = \frac{Q}{\phi}
\end{equation}
- into the [[file:materialtimederivative.org][Material balance equation]]
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} + \nabla (\rho \phi v) = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} + \nabla (\rho Q) = 0
\end{equation}
- first we need to do some work on the [[file:materialbalance.org][material balance equation]]
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} + \nabla (\rho \phi v) = 0
\end{equation}
- aplying product rule to the material balance equation for porous media
\begin{equation}
\phi \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \rho \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + \nabla \rho . Q + \rho \nabla Q = 0
\end{equation}
- density and porosity are functions of pressure and space
\begin{equation}
\rho = \rho(P(x)) ; \phi = \phi(P(x))
\end{equation}
- applying chain rule to obtain the equation in terms of gradients of pressure
- and taking out the term \rho \phi from the first two terms
\begin{equation}
\rho \phi [
\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial P}\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} +
\frac{1}{\phi} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial P}\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}
] +
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial P} \nabla P . Q + \rho \nabla Q =
0
\end{equation}
- substituting terms for fluid [[file:isothermalcompressibility.org][compressibility]]
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial P}
\end{equation}
- and rock compressibility
\begin{equation}
C_R = \frac{1}{\phi} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial P}
\end{equation}
- and dividing the whole equation by \rho
\begin{equation}
\phi [C + C_R] \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} +
\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial P} \nabla P Q + \nabla Q =
0
\end{equation}
- again we have fluid compressibility in the second term
- and defining total compressibility as
\begin{equation}
C_t = C+C_R
\end{equation}
- and let's substitute Darcy's law ignoring gravity term (horizontal flow)
\begin{equation}
Q = -\frac{k}{\mu} (\nabla P)
\end{equation}
- we have
\begin{equation}
\phi C_t \frac{\partial P}{\partial t} -
C \nabla P (\frac{k}{\mu} \nabla P) -
\nabla (\frac{k}{\mu} \nabla P) =
0
\end{equation}
- and assuming homogeneous and isotropic permeability, we can factor out permeability from the last two terms
- we get the general form of the diffusivity equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\mu \phi C_t}{k}
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} =
\nabla.(\nabla P) +
C (\nabla P.\nabla P)
\end{equation}
- assuming small and constant compressibility, the final term becomes negligible, giving the Pressure Diffusivity Equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} =
\alpha
\nabla.(\nabla P)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \frac{k}{\mu \phi C_t}
\end{equation}
- this has the same form as the [[file:heatdifferentialequation.org][heat equation]]
- the above formulation is called the strong form of the pressure diffusivity equation
- this requires the derivative of P and the second derivative of P to be continuous throughout the required limits for us to be able to derive a solution
- to relax this requirement, let's derive a weak form of the pressure diffusivity equation
* Methods of Solution
- general solutions can be obtained for a variety of initial and boundary conditions provided the diffusion is constant
- the solution has two standard forms either comprising of
| series of error functions or related integrals | trigonometric series           |
| suited for numerical evaluation at small times | converges large values of time |
- general solution for cylindrical co-ordinates - trigonometric functions are replaced by a series of Bessel functions
** Method of Reflection and Superposition
- solution to the diffusion equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} =
D
(\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2})
\end{equation}
- is of the form
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{A}{t^{1/2}}exp(-\frac{x^2}{4Dt})
\end{equation}
- where A is an arbitrary constant

- the solution is symmetrical with respect to x = 0, and tends to approach 0 as x tends to $\pm \infty$, and approaches $\infty$ as x approaches 0
- total amount of substance diffusing through the media is given as
\begin{equation}
M = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} C dx
\end{equation}
- substituting
\begin{equation}
\epsilon ^2 = \frac{x^2}{4Dt}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
dx = 2(Dt)^{1/2} d \epsilon
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
M = 2 A D^{1/2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} exp(-\epsilon ^2) d\epsilon = 2 A(\pi D)^{1/2}
\end{equation}
- amount diffusing remains constant and equal to the amount orginally deposited in the plane x = 0; therefore substituting for A
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{M}{2(\pi D t)^{1/2}}exp(-\frac{x^2}{4Dt})
\end{equation}
- which is the general solution for the diffusion equation in 1 dimension
*** Impermeable Boundary at x = 0
- 0 if we have an region with impermeable boundary at x = 0, extending over x > 0, the solution is just the solution for negative x superposed over the positive x region
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{M}{(\pi D t)^{1/2}}exp(-\frac{x^2}{4Dt})
\end{equation}
- boundary condition for the impermeable boundary is given as
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial x} = 0; x = 0
\end{equation}
*** Extended Initial Distributions
- if the initial distribution occupies a finite region instead of a point as assumed so far

- consider the following initial distribution at t = 0
\begin{equation}
C = C_0; x < 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C = 0; x > 0
\end{equation}
- the soltion is assumed to composed of an infinite number of line sources superimposed with each other
- consider an element of width $\partial \epsilon$ to be a line source of strength $C_0 \partial \epsilon$
- concentration at point is given as
\begin{equation}
C = \frac{C_0 \partial \epsilon}{(\pi D t)^{1/2}}exp(-\frac{x^2}{4Dt})
\end{equation}
- let's now integrate it to find the solution
- substitute
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{\epsilon}{2\sqrt{Dt}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C(x,t) = 
\frac{C_0}{2 (\pi D t)^{1/2}} \int_{x} ^{\infty} exp (-\epsilon ^2 / 4 D t) d \epsilon = 
\frac{C_0}{\pi^{1/2}} \int_{x/2\sqrt{Dt}}^{\infty} exp (-\eta^2) d \eta
\end{equation}
- let's substitute the [[file:errorfunction.org][error function]], which enters into the solution of a diffusion problem as a consequence of summing the effect of a series of line sources each yeilding an exponential type of distribution
\begin{equation}
erf(x) 
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{-x}^{x} exp(-t^2) dt
= \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_{0}^{x} exp(-t^2) dt
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
C(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}C_0 erfc(\frac{x}{2\sqrt{Dt}})
\end{equation}
- for a region initially confined to -h < x < h
\begin{equation}
C(x,t) = \frac{1}{2}C_0(erf\frac{h-x}{2\sqrt{Dt}}+erf\frac{h+x}{2\sqrt{Dt}})
\end{equation}
** Method of Separation of Variables
- substitute 
\begin{equation}
C = X(x) T(t)
\end{equation}
- where X and T are functions of x and t respectively
\begin{equation}
X\frac{dT}{dt} = DT\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{T}\frac{dT}{dt} = \frac{D}{X}\frac{d^2X}{dx^2}
\end{equation}
- we now have two ODEs whose result must be a constant; let's assume this constant is $-\lambda^2 D$ for the sake of convenience, yeilding the following ODEs
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{T}\frac{dT}{dt} = -\lambda^2 D
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{X}\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\lambda^2
\end{equation}
- the solutions are given as
\begin{equation}
T = exp(-\lambda ^2 Dt)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
X = A sin \lambda x + B cos \lambda x
\end{equation}
- resulting in the following solution for C
\begin{equation}
C = ( A sin \lambda x + B cos \lambda x ) exp (- \lambda^2 Dt)
\end{equation}
- the most general solution is obtained by summing all particular solutions for the diffusion equation with constant diffusivity (since it's linear)
\begin{equation}
C = \Sigma _{m=1} ^{\infty} ( A_m sin \lambda _m x + B _m cos \lambda _m x ) exp (- \lambda _m ^2 Dt)
\end{equation}
- where $A_m, B_m, and \lambda _m$ are determined by intial and boundary conditions for any particular problem
** Method of [[file:laplacetransform.org][Laplace Transform]]
- application of Laplace Transform to the diffusion equation removes the time variable leaving an ODE the solution of which yields the transform of the concentration as a function of the space variables x,y,z
- Laplace Transform is defined as
\begin{equation}
f(p) = \int _{0} ^{\infty} f(t) e^{-pt} dt
\end{equation}
- where p is a sufficiently large number to make the itegral converge - it may be a complex number whose real part is sufficiently large
* Weak Form
- recall that P is a function of space and time
\begin{equation}
P = P(x,t)
\end{equation}
- let's multiply the Pressure Diffusivity Equation with a function w, which is only a function of space
\begin{equation}
w(x) \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial t} -
w(x) \alpha
\nabla.(\nabla P(x,t)) =
0
\end{equation}
- integrating over the entire body \Omega
\begin{equation}
\int _\Omega w(x) \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial t} -
\int _\Omega w(x) \alpha
\nabla.(\nabla P(x,t)) =
0
\end{equation}
- \alpha is constant; we can take it out
- applying [[file:divergencetheorem.org][divergence theorem]] to the second term
\begin{equation}
\int _\Omega w(x) \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial t} +
\alpha \int _\Omega \nabla w(x) \nabla P(x,t) dx +
\alpha \int _{\partial \Omega} ^\Omega \nabla w(x) \nabla P(x,t) dx =
0
\end{equation}
- this is the weak form of the Pressure Diffusivity Equation, as we have weakened the continuity requirement on P
- in the original equation we needed the equation to be continuous on the entire range of the density (Pressure) function P; in the weak form we ave shifted some of that continuity requirement on to the new function w
- w(x) is a completely arbitrary function
- we will define it as the [[file:deltafunction.org][Dirac delta function]] to simplify discretization
\begin{equation}
w(x) = \delta(X-X_i)
\end{equation}
- this weak from allows us to unify different discretization methods for reservoir simulations - finite difference, finite volume
* Discretization
- the diffusion equation may be discretized in both space and time, or in only one of the two components, based on application
  - in discretizing time alone, corresponds to taking time slices of the continuous system and no new phenomena arise
  - in discretizing space alone, the [[file:greensfunction.org][Green's Function]] becomes the discrete Gaussian kernel rather than the continuous [[file:gaussianfunction.org][Gaussian kernel]]
  - in discretizing both space and time, a [[file:randomwalk.org][random walk]] is obtained
- to understand the concept of [[file:finitedifference.org][finite difference]] let's rewrite the weak form equation in one dimension

         0<--------------------x------------------>l
         +-----------------------------------------+
         |                                         |
         |               core                      |
         |                                         |
         +-----------------------------------------+

- the differntial term (the 3rd term) in the weak form equation, is just a point in one dimension, and therefore becomes a limit

\begin{equation}
\int _0 ^l \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial t} dx +
\alpha \int _0 ^l \frac{\partial w(x)}{\partial t} \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial x} dx +
\alpha [w(x) \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial x}] _0 ^l =
0
\end{equation}

- let us divide the core into n parts

 |---x0---|---x1---|---x2---|...|---x(n-2)---|---x(n-1)---|
  \Deltax0 \Deltax1 \Deltax2     \Deltax(n-2) \Deltax(n-1)

- rewriting the one dimensional weak form equation as a finite difference expansion

\begin{equation}
\Sigma _{i=0} ^{i=n-1} [
\int _{x_i-\Delta x_i / 2} ^{x_i + \Delta x_i / 2} w(x) \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial t} dx +
\alpha \int _{x_i-\Delta x_i / 2} ^{x_i + \Delta x_i / 2} \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial x} dx -
\alpha [w(x) \frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial x}] _{x_i-\Delta x_i / 2} ^{x_i + \Delta x_i / 2}
]
= 0
\end{equation}

- now let's take advantage of the fact that w(x) is a delta function
- for the first term
\begin{equation}
\int _{a - \epsilon} ^{a + \epsilon} f(x) \frac{\partial \delta (x-a)}{\partial x} dx = - \frac{\partial f(a)}{\partial x}
\end{equation}
- for the second term
\begin{equation}
\int _{a - \epsilon} ^{a + \epsilon} f(x) \delta (x-a) dx = f(a)
\end{equation}
- for the third term
\begin{equation}
\delta(x \neq 0) = 0
\end{equation}
- now we have
\begin{equation}
\Sigma _{i=0} ^{i=n-1} [
\frac{\partial P(x,t)}{\partial t} -
\alpha \frac{\partial ^2 P(x,t)}{\partial x ^2}
]
= 0
\end{equation}
- now we need a way to approximate these derivatives using [[file:finitedifference.org][finite difference]] - central difference approximation
- for first derivative
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} =
\frac{p(x+\Delta x) - p(x-\Delta x)}{2 \Delta x} +
\frac{1}{3!} \frac{\partial ^3 p}{\partial x^3} \Delta x^3 +
\dots
\end{equation}
- for second derivative
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x^2} =
\frac{p(x+\Delta x) - 2 p(x) + p(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x ^2} +
\frac{1}{4!} \frac{\partial ^4 p}{\partial x^4} \Delta x^4 +
\dots
\end{equation}
- substituting in the diffusion equation and performing summation
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial p_0}{\partial t} + \frac{\alpha}{\Delta x ^2} [-p_{1} + 2p_{0} - p_{-1}] +
\frac{\partial p_1}{\partial t} + \frac{\alpha}{\Delta x ^2} [-p_{2} + 2p_{1} - p_{0}] +
\dots +
\frac{\partial p_{n-1}}{\partial t} + \frac{\alpha}{\Delta x ^2} [-p_{n} + 2p_{n-1} - p_{-n-2}] =
0
\end{equation}
- in matrix notation
