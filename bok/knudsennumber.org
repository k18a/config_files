#+TITLE: Knudsen Number

- ratio of molecular mean free path to a representative physical length scale
- helps determine whether statistical mechanics or continuum mecanics formulation of fluid dynamics should be used to model the phenomenon
  - if Knudsen number is near or greater than 1, continuum mechanics is no longer a good approximation, and therefore stastical methods should be used

\begin{equation}
Kn = \frac{\lambda}{L}
\end{equation}

- Kn is Knudsen number
- \lambda is mean free path
- L is representative physical length scale

- substuting for mean free path for a Boltzmann gas

\begin{equation}
Kn = \frac{k_B T}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 p L}
\end{equation}

- k_B is [[file:boltzmann.org][Boltzmann constant]]
- T is temperature
- d is particle hard shell diameter
- p is pressure

* Relationship with Other Dimensionless Numbers

- Knudsen number is related to [[file:reynoldsnumber.org][Reynolds Number]] and [[file:machnumber.org][Mach Number]] as follows

\begin{equation}
Kn = \frac{Ma}{Re}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma \pi}{2}}
\end{equation}

- \gamma is ratio of specific heats
- Ma is Mach number
- Re is Reynolds number
