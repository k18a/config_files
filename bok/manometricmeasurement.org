* Manometric Measurement of Adsorption 
- Manometric methods of adsorption are preferred for low temperature (77 K) applications cite:Sing1985

* Sample Preparation 

- Outgassing parameters depend on the nature of the system at hand and the application required cite:Sing1985
- Determination of outgassed mass of the sample is a major source of discrepancy between different experiments cite:Sing1985
- Inorganic oxides are outgassed at about $150 ^0C$, whilst microporous substances such as activated charcoal and zeolites require a much higher temperature $300 ^0C$ cite:Sing1985 

* Temperature Control
- As pressure within an enclosed cell is strongly temperature-dependent, adequate temperature control is essential cite:Sing1985 

* Equilibrium Determination

* Error Analysis 

- Relative errors must be calculated for both experimental measurements and the isotherm fit.
