#+TITLE: Parachor

- parachors are empirical parameters
\begin{equation}
P = \frac{\gamma ^{1/4} M}{\rho}
\end{equation}
- $\gamma$ is surface tension
- M is molar mass
- $\rho$ is density
- in reservoir simulation
- parachors are empirical parameters
- parachor of component i can be estimated using the molecular weight of the component M_i and the empirical regression equation
\begin{equation}
P _{chi} = 10.0 + 2.92 M_i
\end{equation}
  - this equation works reasonably well for molecular weights ranging from 100 to 500
