- usually derived from [[file:reynoldstranporttheorem.org][Reynolds Transport Theorem]]
  
* From Reynolds Transport Theorem


* [[file:materialtimederivative.org][Material form of Mass Conservation Equation]]
- an alternative method to deriving mass conservation compared to Reynolds Transport Theorem
** Time Derivative Form
- consider a control volume, whose shape and volume can change over time, but is of fixed mass and material
- a particle located at X in the reference configuration is now located at x in current configuration 

      reference t = 0                   current t = t

- reference configuration is at time t=0
- $\omega_0$ represents all particles in the control volume at time t=0
- the control volume changes over time
- $\Chi$ represents a mapping function that maps the position of a particle x from time 0 to current time t
- since x(t=0) is represented by X (see [[file:materialtimederivative.org][Material Time Derivative]]), \Chi maps co-ordinates from Lagrangian to Eulerian co-ordinates
- $\Chi$ is a function of X and t
\begin{equation}
x = \chi (X,t)
\end{equation}
- based on our definition, the mass of the particles in the reference configuration equals mass of particles in current configuration
\begin{equation}
m(\omega_0) = m(\omega)
\end{equation}
- m represents mass of particles
- in differential form
\begin{equation}
dm(X) = dm(x)
\end{equation}
- X represents position vector in Lagrangian coordinates, and x represents position vector in Eulerian co-ordinates
- dm is differntial mass
- mass is volume times density
\begin{equation}
\rho_0(X) \phi(X) dV_0 = \rho(x,t) \phi(x,t) dV 
\end{equation}
- $\rho$ is density
- $\phi$ is rock porosity
- dV is differential volume
- integrating this 
\begin{equation}
\int \int \int _{\omega_0} \rho_0(X) \phi_0(X) dX_1 dX_2 dX_3= \int \int \int _{\omega} \rho(x,t) \phi(x,t) dx_1 dx_2 dx_3
\end{equation}
- we can use a Jacobian determinant to convert Eulerian co-ordinates to Lagrangian co-ordinates
\begin{equation}
\int \int \int _{\omega_0} \rho_0(X) \phi(X) dX_1 dX_2 dX_3= \int \int \int _{\omega} \rho(x,t) \phi(x,t) J dX_1 dX_2 dX_3
\end{equation}
- J is the Jacobian determinant which converts from x to X, given as J = det(F)
\begin{equation}
J = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial X_1} & \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial X_2} & \frac{\partial x_1}{\partial X_3} \\
 \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial X_1} & \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial X_2} & \frac{\partial x_2}{\partial X_3} \\
 \frac{\partial x_3}{\partial X_1} & \frac{\partial x_3}{\partial X_2} & \frac{\partial x_3}{\partial X_3} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
- representing 
\begin{equation}
F_{ij} = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_j}
\end{equation}
- the Jacobian is given as 
\begin{equation}
J = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 F_{11} & F_{12} & F_{13} \\
 F_{21} & F_{22} & F_{23} \\
 F_{31} & F_{32} & F_{33} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
- in simplified notation
\begin{equation}
\int _{\omega_0} \rho_0(X) \phi_0(X) dV_0 = \int _{\omega} \rho(x,t) \phi(x,t) J dV_0
\end{equation}
- the statement of mass conservation is thus given as
\begin{equation}
\rho_0(X) \phi_0(X) = \rho(x,t) \phi(x,t) J
\end{equation}
- this is equivalent to other forms of material balance
- this form is often known as the material form of conservation of mass
** Regular Form
- to get to a more familiar form, we need to take the material time derivative on both sides of the equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt} (\rho _0 \phi _0) = \frac{D}{Dt} (\rho \phi J)
\end{equation}
- left hand side is constant
\begin{equation}
0 = \frac{D}{Dt} (\rho \phi J)
= J \frac{D}{Dt} (\rho \phi) + \rho \phi \frac{D}{Dt} J 
= J [\frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} + \nabla (\rho \phi) * v] + \rho \phi \frac{D}{Dt} J
\end{equation}
- let's figure out the second term for now
- applying chain rule, since F is a function of time
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt} J = \frac{D}{Dt} (det F)
= \frac{\partial det F}{\partial F_{ij}} \frac{\partial F_{ij}}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
- partial of the determinant of a matrix with respect to its components is equal to the determinant of the matrix times the transpose inverse of the matrix
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial det F}{\partial F_{ij}} \frac{\partial F_{ij}}{\partial t} 
= 
det F (F_{ji}) ^{-1} \frac{\partial F_{ij}}{\partial t} 
\end{equation}
- since det F = J; inverse transpose is just the elemenets reversed in the first term
- also since x in F is a function of X and t in the second term
\begin{equation}
J \frac{\partial X _i}{\partial x _j} \frac{\partial }{\partial t} \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_j} 
\end{equation}
- rearranging differntial terms
\begin{equation}
J \frac{\partial X _i}{\partial x _j} \frac{\partial }{\partial X_j} \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial t} 
\end{equation}
- the last term is nothing but the velocity
\begin{equation}
J \frac{\partial X _i}{\partial x _j} \frac{\partial V_i}{\partial X_j} 
\end{equation}
- rearranging
\begin{equation}
J \frac{\partial V _i}{\partial x _j} \frac{\partial X_i}{\partial X_j} 
\end{equation}
- the last term is the identity matrix
\begin{equation}
J \frac{\partial V _i}{\partial x _j} \delta_{ij} 
\end{equation}
- the identity matrix is represented by the Kronecker delta function, also known as the identity matrix
\begin{equation}
\delta _{ij} = 1 if i=j
\delta _{ij} = 0 otherwise
\end{equation}
- multiplication of any matrix with an identity matrix is itself
\begin{equation}
J \frac{\partial V _i}{\partial x _j}
\end{equation}
- in slightly different notation
\begin{equation}
J \nabla v
\end{equation}
- going back to our initial material balance
\begin{equation}
0 = J [\frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} + \nabla (\rho \phi) * v] + \rho \phi J \nabla v
\end{equation}
- simplifying
\begin{equation}
0 = \frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} + \nabla (\rho \phi) * v + \rho \phi \nabla v
\end{equation}
- the last 2 terms represent the product rule
- the 3 dimensional mass conservation equation is given as
\begin{equation}
0 = \frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} + \nabla (\rho \phi v)
\end{equation}
- expanding the divergence operator \nabla
\begin{equation}
0 = \frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} + 
\frac{\partial (\rho \phi v_x)}{\partial x} +
\frac{\partial (\rho \phi v_y)}{\partial y} +
\frac{\partial (\rho \phi v_z)}{\partial z}
\end{equation}
- for non porous media
\begin{equation}
0 = \frac{\partial (\rho)}{\partial t} + \nabla (\rho v)
\end{equation}
