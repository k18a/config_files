#+TITLE: Vector Triangle Inequality
- the length of the vector [x] + [y] is always less than or equal to the sum of lengths of the individual vectors [x] and [y]  
\begin{equation}
|| [x] + [y] || \leq ||[x]|| + ||[y]||
\end{equation}
- the lengths are equal only of [x] and [y] are linearly dependent
\begin{equation}
|| [x] + [y] || = ||[x]|| + ||[y]|| \leftrightarrow [x] = c.[y]
\end{equation}
