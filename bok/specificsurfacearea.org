#+TITLE: Specific Surface Area

- SSA is the accessible area of the solid surface per unit mass of the material cite:Sing1985
- The SSA is usually calculated from low pressure N2 or CO2 isotherms.
- It may also be calculated from high-pressure Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP), and ultra-/small angle neutron scattering (USANS/SANS).
