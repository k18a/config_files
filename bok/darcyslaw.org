#+TITLE: Darcy's Law

- in the absence of gravitational forces, Darcy's law is a simple proportional relationship between the instantaneous flow rate through a porous medium of permeability k, viscosity, and pressure drop
\begin{equation}
Q = -\frac{k A \Delta P}{\mu L} 
\end{equation}

- negative sign indicates that fluid flows from high pressure to low pressure

- dividing by area we obtain the Darcy velocity
- Darcy velocity, q, is the volume per unit time flowing through the cross section
\begin{equation}
q = -\frac{k}{\mu} (\nabla P)
\end{equation}

- accounting for the effects of gravity we have
\begin{equation}
q = -\frac{k}{\mu} (\nabla P - \rho g)
\end{equation}

- actual velocity, v, is given by dividing Darcy velocity with porosity
\begin{equation}
v = \frac{q}{\phi} = -\frac{k}{\mu} (\nabla P - \rho g)
\end{equation}
- permeability, k, is a tensor
- pressure gradient \nabla P is a vector
- gravity is a vector
- velocity is a vector

* Derivation

- for stationary, creeping, incompressible flow, the [[file:navierstokesequation.org][Navier-Stokes equation]] is given as
\begin{equation}
\mu \Delta ^2 u _i + \rho g_i - \partial _i p = 0
\end{equation}
- \mu is viscosity
- u_i is velocity in direction i
- g_i is gravity component in direction i
- p is pressure

- assuming viscous force is linear with velocity
\begin{equation}
-(k_{ij})^{-1} \mu \phi u_j + \rho g_i - \partial_i p = 0
\end{equation}
- \phi is porosity
- k_{ij} is second order permeability tensor

- rearranging and multiplying both sides with k_{ij}, gives the equation for darcy velocity
\begin{equation}
q = -\frac{k}{\mu} (\nabla P - \rho g)
\end{equation}

* Darcy-Forchheimer Law

- for flows in porous media with [[file:reynoldsnumber.org][Reynolds Number]] greater than about 1 to 10, the inertial effects can also become significant
- The Darcy-Forchheimer equation accounts for the inertial effects
  
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = -\frac{\mu}{k} q - \frac{\rho}{k_i} q^2
\end{equation}
- ki is known as the inertial permeability
  
* Knudsen Diffusion

- for flow in small characteristic dimensions, the particle-wall interactions become more frequent giving rise to additional wall friction (knudsen friction), modelled as [[file:knudsendiffusion.org][Knudsen Diffusion]]
  - this is termed as the Klinkenberg effect by geologists
- for flow in this region, with both viscous and knudsen forces, the Knudsen equation is given as

\begin{equation}
N = -(\frac{k}{\mu} \frac{p_a + p_b}{2} + D _k ^{eff}) \frac{1}{R _g T} \frac{p_b - p_a}{L}
\end{equation}

- N is the molar flux
- R_g is gas constant
- T is temperature
- D_k eff is effective Knudsen diffusivity of the porous media

- substituting for molar flux and rearranging

\begin{equation}
q = -\frac{k}{\mu} (1+\frac{D_k \mu}{k} \frac{1}{p}) \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
\end{equation}

- comparing with Darcy's law
\begin{equation}
q = -\frac{k_{eff}}{\mu} (\nabla P)
\end{equation}
- effective permeability is given as
\begin{equation}
k_{eff} = k(1+\frac{D_k \mu}{k} \frac{1}{p})
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
k_{eff} = k(1+\frac{b}{p})
\end{equation}

- b is known as the klinkenberg parameter
