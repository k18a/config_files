#+TITLE: Wettability

- ability of a fluid phase to wet a solid surface preferentially in the presence of a second immiscible phase
- wetting or wettability depends on the surface energies of the components involved
- adding chemicals such as surfactants can alter wettability

* Contact Angle

- wettability is measured by contact angle
- contact angle is always measured throught the denser phase
- contact angle is related to the interfacial energy as
  - $\sigma _{OS} - \sigma _{WS} = \sigma _{OW} cos \theta$
    - \sigma_{OS} interfacial energy between oil and solid
    - \simga_{WS} interfacial energy between water and solid
    - \sigma_{OW} interfacial energy between oil and water
    - \theta contact angle at oil-water-solid interface measured through the water phase
| wettability          | contact angle |
| strongly water wet   |          0-30 |
| moderately water wet |         30-75 |
| neutrally wet        |        75-105 |
| moderately oil wet   |       105-150 |
| strongly oil wet     |       150-180 |
- wettability can be changed by the contact of core with drilling fluids or fluids on the rig floor and by contact with oxygen or water from atmosphere
- laboratory fluids should be at reservoir conditions to obtain the most reliable measurements of wettability
