#+TITLE: Matrixyl 

- trademark of Sederma SAS
- contains a specific matrikine - palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 
- contains a peptide of 5 amino acids linked to a 16-carbon chain for improving the penetration of the molecule through the lipidic structures of the skin

- Matrikine 
  - small molecule composed of a short sequence of amino-acids, peptides, derived from the surrounding extracellular matrix constituting a signal in order to regulate cell activity
  - matrikines play an important role in the wound healing process and connective tissue remodelling

- Matrixyl 3000
  - the most advanced form of Matrixyl available for anti-ageing
  - particularly effective in repairing photo-aged skin

- Mechanism
  - cells use clearly defined signalling pathways to transfer information from the cell surface to the internal effector system (genes) to react to their environment
  - a matrikine peptide can link to a matching cell-surface receptor which is coupled to a transducer to relay information into the cell using various signalling pathways
  - so different matrikines can trigger different messages - structure of the matrikine is important for a given application
