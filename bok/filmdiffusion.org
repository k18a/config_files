#+TITLE: Film Diffusion

* Steady Diffusion Across Thin Film
- mathematically straightforward but with very important consequences for diffusion
  
- consider a thin film of thickness l, containing well-mixed solutions on each side of different concentrations
- [[./steadydiffusionthinfilm.jpg]]
- the first step is always to write a mass balance
- mass balance accross a thin section \Delta z, z units of distance from the lseft side of the film
  - accumulation = rate of diffusion into layer at z - rate of diffusion out of layer at (z + \Delta z)
- at steady state accumulation is 0
  - $0 = A(J_z - J_{(z + \Delta z)})$
  - J is the flux
  - A is area
  - z is distance
- at very small \Delta z
  - $0 = - \frac{d}{dz}J$
- Fick's First Law
  - $J = D \frac{d C}{dz}$
- differentiating Fick's first law for a constant D
  - $0 = D \frac{d^2 C}{d z^2}$
- boundary conditions
  - at $z = 0, C = C_{0}$
  - at $z = l, C = C_{l}$
- solution to the differential equation is of the form
  - $C = a + b z$
- integrating with the given boundary conditions
  - $C = C_{0} + (C_{l} - C_{0})\frac{z}{l}$
- as expected concentration varies linearly with distance as shown in the figure
- as the system is in steady state, flux is constant
  - $j = -D \frac{dC}{dz} = \frac{D}{l} (C_{0} - C_{l})$

** Steady Diffusion with Concentration Dependent Diffusion Coefficient

- treatment remains same but with boundary conditions
  - $z = 0, C_1 = C_{1 0}$
  - $z = l, C_1 = C_{1 l}$
- $C_1 = C_{10} (1-\frac{z}{l})^{1/2}$
- combined with Fick's laws
  - $J = -D \frac{dC_1}{dz}
  - = -\frac{D_0 C_1}}{c_{10}}\frac{dc_1}{dz}
  - = \frac{D_0 C_{10}

* Linear Driving Force Rate Law

- derivation from cite:Qiu2009
- rate of solute acumulation in sold phase is equal to the rate of solute transfer across the liquid film
- $V_p (\frac{\partial q}{\partial t}) = k_f A_s (C - C_i)$
  - V_p is volume of particles
  - q is average solute concentration in the solid
  - t is time
  - k_f is mass transfer coefficient
  - A_s is surface area of particle
  - (C-C_i) is the concentration driving force
    - C_i is concentration of solute at the interface
    - C is concentration of solute in the bulk phase
- substituting surface area per unit volume
  - $S_0 = A_s/V_p$
- we get the linear driving force rate law
- $\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = k_f S_0 (C - C_i)$

* Film Diffusion Mass Transfer Equation 

- derivation from cite:Qiu2009
- $ln(1-\frac{q_t}{q_e}) = - R t$
- $R = \frac{3D_e}{r_0 \Delta r_0 k}
  - R is liquid film diffusion constant
  - D_e is efective liquid film diffusion coefficient
  - r_0 is radius of adsorbent beads
  - \Delta r_0 is thickness of liquid film
  - k is equilibrium constant of adsorption
- a plot of $ln(1-\frac{q_t}{q_e})$ against t should be a straight line if film diffusion is the rate determining step
- then the corrected film diffusion coefficient can be evaluated
