#+TITLE: Decline Curve Analysis
- proposed by cite:Arps1945
- relationship between flowrate and time for producing wells assuming constant flowing pressure
- $\frac{dq}{dt} = -a q ^{n+1}$
  - a and n are empirically determined constants
  - n ranges from 0 to 1
- this equation is fitted to flowrate data to perform decline curve analysis
- three types of decline curves are possible based on the value of n
- Exponential Decline Curve
  - n=0
  - $q = q_i e ^{-at}$
  - q_i is the initial flow rate
  - a is empirical constant
- Hyperbolic Decline Curve
  - 0<n<1
  - $q ^{-n} = nat + q _i ^{-n}$
  - q_i is initial rate
  - a is empirical constant
- Harmonic Decline Curve
  - n=1
  - $q ^{-1} = nat + q _i ^{-1}$
  - q_i is initial rate
  - a is empirical constant
- decline curves are fit to actual data by plotting the logarithm of observed rates vs time t
- $ln q = ln q_i - at$
  - ln q_i is the intercept
  - a is the slope
