#+TITLE: Colligative Properties

* Colligative Properties

- properties of solutions that depend on the ratio of number of solute particles to the number of solvent molecules in a solution, and not on the nature of the chemical species present
- derived from Latin colligatus, meaning bound together
- assumption that solution properties are independent of the nature of the solution is only valid for [[file:idealrealsolution.org][ideal solitions]] and approximately valid for dilute real solutions
- they are basically solvent properties that are changed by the presence of the solute

Colligative properties include

- relative lowering of [[file:vapourpressure.org][vapour pressure]]
- elevation of boiling point
- depression of freezing point
- [[file:osmoticpressure.org][osmotic pressure]]
