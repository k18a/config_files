#+TITLE: Reservoir Characterization
* Terminology
- resources
  - total amount of hydrocarbons in the play, irrespective of whether they are recoverable or not
- reserves
  - amount of recoverable hydrocarbons based on an estimated recovery factor
- recovery factor
  - an estimated amount of the total hydrocarbons present that is expected to be produced; expressed as a percentage
* Petroleum Plays
** Hydrocarbon Production
 - biogenic gas
   - produced by micro-organisms as a metabolic by-product of anoxic conditions in marshes, bogs, landfills, and shallow sediments
 - thermogenic gas
   - produced through the maturation of buried organic material
** Un-conventional Petroleum Plays
** Shales
- shales are the largest sedimentary strata on the Earth's curst cite:Garrels1969
- shales often comprise the source rock in conventional petroleum plays - hydrocarbons generated in organic rich shales following burial migrate through carrier beds into porous reservoir rocks such as sandstones or carbonates
- in a shale play, shales comprose both the source and the reservoir rock, and thus the target for exploration
- the advent of hydraulic fracturing technology in recent years have allowed for the economic exploitation of shales
*** Criteria for Successful Shale Plays
| criteria        | ideal range | reference |
| kerogen content |             |           |
| kerogen type    |             |           |
* Reservoir Characteristics
** Kerogen Type
- there are 4 basic types of kerogen in organic matter
*** Type 1 Kerogen
- can generate both oil and gas
- indicates a lacustrine or marine environment
*** Type 2 Kerogen
- can generate both oil and gas
- indicates exclusively marine environments
- includes plat spores, exines, resins, and bacterially degraded algal matter
- primarily generates oil during maturation; further maturation at higher temperatures produce gas
*** Type 3 Kerogen
- mainly generates gas
- organic materials is comprosed of vitrinite - woody materials
- typically found in woody material in continental rocks, but can also be found in marine environments when it's washed away
*** Type 4 Kerogen
- little to no potential to generate hydrocarbons
- organic material comprises of intertinite - oxidised woody material
** Rock Eval Pyrolysis
- used to identify the type and maturity of organic matter
- used to detect petroleum potential in sediments
- cannot be used to make real-time drilling decisions because of the lengthy sample preparation, running, and interpretation time
- consists of programmed temperature heating in a pyrolysis oven in an inert atmosphere (helium) of a small sample (~100 mg) to quantitatively and selectively determine
  - the free hydrocarbons contained in the sample
  - the hydrocarbon and oxygen-containing compounds (CO2) that are volatized during the cracking of the unextractable organic matter in the sample (kerogen)
*** S1 Peak
- S1 peak is the amount of free hyrdocarbons (gas and oil) in the sample in mg of hydrocarbons per gram of rock
  - 300 degC
  - 3 min
  - free hydrocarbons are volatized
  - released hydrocarbons are measured as S1 peak
  - if S1 > 1 mg/g, it may indicate an oil show
  - S1 normally increases with depth
  - contamination of samples with drilling fluids can give an abnormally high value for S1
*** S2 Peak
- S2 peak is the amount of hydrocarbons generated through the thermal crackng of nonvolatile organic matter
  - 300 to 550 degC increase
  - at 25 degC/min
  - very heavy hydrocarbons > C40 are volatized
  - non-volatile organic matter is cracked
  - released hydrocarbons are measured as S2 peak
  - S2 is tan indication of the quantity of hydrocarbons that the rock can potentially produce with maturation
  - S2 normally decreases with increasing depth
*** Tmax
- Tmax is the temperature at which S2 reaches maximum
  - Tmax is an indication of the stage of maturation of the organic matter
*** S3 Peak
- S3 peak is the amount of CO2 in mg CO2 per g of rock produced during pyrolysis of kerogen
  - CO2 issued from kerogen is trapped in the 300 to 390 degC
  - CO2 released is detected during the pyrolysis oven and recorded as the S3 peak
  - S3 is an indication of the amount of oxygen in the kerogen and is used to calculate the oxygen index
  - abnormally high S3 values may suggest sample contamination
*** Hydrogen Index
- $HI = \frac{100*S2}{TOC}$
- HI is used to characterize the origin of organic matter
- marine organisms and algae are composed of lipid and protein rich organic matter, where ratio of H to C is higher than in the carbohydrate rich constituents of land plants
- HI typically ranges from 100 to 600 in geologic samples
*** Oxygen Index
- $OI = \frac{100*S3}{TOC}$
- is a parameter that correlates with the ratio of O to C, which is high for polysacharride-rich remains of land plants and inert organic material (residual organic matter) encountered as background in marine sediments
- OI values range from 0 to 150
*** Production Index
- $PI = \frac{S1}{S1+S2}$
- PI is used to chracterize the evolution level of organic matter
*** Pyrolyzable Carbon
- $PC = 0.083 * (S1 + S2)$
- PC corresponds to carbon content of the hydrocarbons volatized and pyrolyzed during the analysis
* Resource Estimation Methedologies
- there are several resource estimation methedologies
