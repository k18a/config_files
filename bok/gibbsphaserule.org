#+TITLE: Gibbs Phase Rule

* Phase Rule

- gives the degrees of freedom - the largest number of independent intensive variables that can be varied simultaneously and arbitrarily without determine one another
- since phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium, chemical potentials of different phases must be equal; this limits the number of intensive variables that can be defined
- also known as state postulate
- defines the number of properties that need to be specified to fully define a thermodynamic system in a state of equilibrium 
- for example, the state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent intensive properties

$F=C-P+2$

- F is the number of degrees of freedom
- C is the number of components 
- P is the number of phases
