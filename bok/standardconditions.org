* Standard Conditions

- standard sets of conditions for experimental measurements to be established 
- allow comparisons to be made between different data sets
- different institutes and organisations sometimes set their own standard conditions
- a different concept from Gibbs Standard state

** IUPAC

- until 1982: 
  - 273.15 K
  - 1 atm
- after 1982: 
  - 273.15 K
  - 1 bar
- usually known as standard temperature and pressure (STP)

** NIST

- 293.15 K (20 degC) 
- 1 atm
- usually known as normal temperature and pressure (NTP)
- standard cubic foot for gases is at 70 degC and 1 atm 

** ISO 

- 20 degC
- 1 atm
- 50% RH

** SPE

- 15 degC
- 1 bar
- standard cubic foot for natural gas is at 60 degF and 1 atm (defined as surface temperature and pressure)

* Gibbs Standard State

- a concept different from standard conditions
- reference point used to calculate the properties 
  - of a substance ( or a mixture or a solution ) under different conditions
- standard state need not actually exist in the physical world and can be purely hypothetical
- standard pressure is usually taken as 1 bar based on IUPAC recommendations
- strictly speaking temperature is not part of the standard state, 
  - but most thermodynamic properties are commonly reported at either 25 degC or 0 degC
- for most elements, the reference point is defined for the most stable [allotrope](allotrope) of the element
- for solutions the standard state is the hypothetical state 
  - it would have at the standard molality or the amount of concentration
  - but exhibiting infinite dilution behaviour
