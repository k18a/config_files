#+TITLE: Phase Diagrams


- shows conditions at which thermodynamically distinct phases occur and co-exist at equilibrium
- phase boundaries are lines of equilibrium that mark conditions at which multiple phases co-exist at equilibrium
- phase boundaries intersect at triple point, where three different phases can coexist
- solidus is the temperature below which substance is stable in the solid state
- liquidus is the temperature above which substance is stable in the liquid state

* PT Diagram 
- slope of the PT diagram is given by the [clausisusclapeyron](clausisusclapeyron) equation
