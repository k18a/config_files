#+TITLE: Weak Formulation
- a function that satisfies an orgthagonal projection of the partial differential equation onto a vector space of functions
- allows us to use [[file:linearalgebra.org][linear algebra]] concepts to solve [[file:differentialequations.org][partial differential equations]]
- basis for [[file:finiteelement.org][finite element methods]] and other variationally based numerical methods
- the strong form and the weak form are equivalent
\begin{equation}
strong form \leftrightarrow weak form
\end{equation}
* Formulation
- consider a function u(x)
\begin{equation}
u(x) \in S
\end{equation}
- S is a space of functions that satisfies Dirichlet boundary conditions at x=0
\begin{equation}
S = \{u | u(0) = u_0\}
\end{equation}
- given data include
  - initial condition, u_0
  - time, t
  - function, f(x)
  - constitutve relation,  $\sigma = E u,_x$
- consider a function w such that
\begin{equation}
\forall w \in V
\end{equation}
- w is a function in a class of functions V that satisfies an homogeneous [[file:boundaryconditions.org][dirichlet boundary condition]] at x=0
\begin{equation}
V = \{w|w(0) = 0\}
\end{equation}
- the following is true
\begin{equation}
\int _0 ^L w,_x \sigma dx = \int_0^L\big(w fdx\big) + w(L) t
\end{equation}
- the above is the weak form in 1D
- in 3D, we just multiply everythin with A
\begin{equation}
\int _0 ^L w,_x \sigma Adx = \int_0 ^L\big(w fAdx\big) + w(L) tA
\end{equation}
- the final term is the boundary force, the other two terms are volume elements
* Steps to get Weak From
1. Move everything over to the left hand side; multiply with the test function; integrate over the entire body
2. Integrate the space differential term (with dx) by parts
3. Impose boundary conditions
