#+TITLE: Linear Isotherm

Most adsorption systems exhibit linear (Henry's law) behavior at low pressures. 

Obtained by substituting a two dimensional analogue of the ideal gas law in to the Gibbs adsorption equation cite:Do1998: $\pi A = n R_g T$

Linear Isotherm: $$\frac{n}{A}=K(T)P$$

where K(T) is the Henry's constant and a function of temerature; $K(T)=C(T)/(R_g T)$, where C(T) is the integration constant.
