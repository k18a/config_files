#+TITLE: Fick's Laws

* Fick's First Law
- an analogy with the [[file:fourierslaws.org][Fourier's laws]] for heat transfer
- rate of transfer of the diffusing substance through unit area of a section is proportional to the concentration gradient measured normal to the section
\begin{equation}
F = D \frac{\partial C}{\partial x}
\end{equation}
- for non isotropic media
\begin{equation}
F_x = 
D_{11} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} +
D_{12} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} +
D_{13} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z} +
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
F_y = 
D_{21} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} +
D_{22} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} +
D_{23} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z} +
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
F_z = 
D_{31} \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} +
D_{32} \frac{\partial C}{\partial y} +
D_{33} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z} +
\end{equation}
- defines mass flux with respect to distance
- first law for cartesian co-ordinates
  - $$J = - A * D * \frac{\partial C}{\partial z}$$
  - J is flux per unit area
  - A is area accross which diffusion occurs
  - C is concentration
  - z is distance
  - D is diffusion coefficient
* Fick's Second Law 
- the mathematics of the second law is considered in more detail in the [[file:diffusionequation.org][diffusion equation]] article
- Fick's second law for isotropic media
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D (
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2} + 
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial y^2} +
\frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial z^2} )
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D (\nabla^2 C)
\end{equation}
- if the media is not isotropic
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = \nabla (D . \nabla C)
\end{equation}
- a more general conservation equation that gives change in concentration with time
  - $$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D * \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial r^2} = D (\frac{\partial ^2 C}{\partial z ^2} + \frac{1}{A} + \frac{\partial A}{\partial z} \frac{\partial C}{\partial z})$$
  - t is time
- For a non-linear isotherm cite:Clarkson1999
  - $$\frac{\partial}{\partial z} (D {\frac{\partial C}{\partial z}}) = \frac{\partial C}{\partial t}$$
* Analogy with Heat Flow
* Diffusion Constant
- much less sensitive to temperature than the rate constant of a chemical reaction or other phenomena
- also much less sensitive to the solute being studied, diffusion constant in a given system for a variety of solutes often fall within a factor of 10
- also much less sensitive to solute concentration, although there are exceptions
  - smaller solutes may show concentration dependent diffusion
