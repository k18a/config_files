#+TITLE: Bowland Basin
- a key part of the Pennine Carboniferous Petroluem System
- the Bowland Basin is a Carboniferous Petroleum System with an estimated TOGIP of 1300 TCF cite:Andrews2013
- the pay region is over 6000 ft thick and naturally fractured cite:Clarke2014
- the Bowland Basin is a mixed clastic-carbonate succession cite:Clarke2014
- the main lithologies are high and low-silt mudstones with occasional clay-rich mixed mudstones, and occasional thin sandstones and dolomitized limestones cite:Clarke2014
- the lithology, being an important control on TOC, high TOC shales aer near the clastic line indicating the probable influence of clastic input on organic carbon deposition cite:Clarke2014
- the stress regime in the Bowland Basin is strike-slip with $S_{hmax}>S_v>S_{hmin}$, as determined from drilling induced tensile fractures with an azimuth of $353-173 ^0C$ cite:Clarke2014
- the TOC in Bowland basin varies from 1 to 7 % with an average value of 2.65% cite:Clarke2014
- Petrographic analysis revealed significant amounts of type III kerogen cite:Clarke2014
- Effective porosity averages 2.8%, and water saturation averages 25% cite:Clarke2014
- Average matrix permeability is $1e{-5} md$. cite:Clarke2014
- Gas Density in the pay region is about 732 MMSCF/Section/meter, with adsorbed gas accounting for about 20% of the TOGIP. Reservoir temperature was about $57 ^0C$, and reservoir pressure was about $22.4 MPa$ cite:Clarke2014
- Facies in the Bowland Basin and corresponding mineral composition in wt% cite:Fauchille2017

- for the purposes of resource estimation the Bowland-Hodder unit was divided into two
  1. upper bowland
  2. lower bowland

* Millstone Grit
  
- an younger shale above the Bowland-Hodder unit
- potential units such as the Arnsbergian-Kinderscoutian Sabden Shale in Lancashire and Holywell Shales in Wales occur within Millstone Grit sandstone sequences cite:Andrews2013

* Upper Bowland
- considered more prospective for hydrocarbon exploration as there's more exploration data available for this basin cite:Andrews2013
- cite:Andrews2013 privided a bottom-up estimate of Total Gas Initially in Place (TGIIP) of 164-264-446 tcf (4.6-7.5-12.7 tcm) (P90-P50-P10)
- post-rift unit; laterally contiguous; organic-rich; condensed zones can be mapped


* Lower Bowland
- syn-rift unit; thousands of feet thick in fault bounded basins; shale is interbedded with mass flow clastic sediments and redeposited carbonates
- cite:Andrews2013 provided a bottom-up estimate TGIIP of 658-1065-1835 tcf (18.6-30.51.9 tcm) (P90-P50-P10) for the lower Bowland unit
- largely unexplored - lateral extent of organic rich shales are not clear at the moment
