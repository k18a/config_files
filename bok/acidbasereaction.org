#+TITLE: Acid Base Reactions

- reaction between an acid and a base


* Models
- should be viewed as complementing each other rather than competing with each other

* Lavoisier Oxygen Theory

- limited to acids containing oxygen
- defined acidsin terms of their containing oxygen
  
* Liebig's Hydrogen Theory

- based on extensive work on organic acids
- acid is an hydrogen containing substance that could be replaced by a metal
- most accepted thoery till adoption of arrhenius definition

* Arrhenius Definition

- first mordern definition of acids and bases
- *arrhenius acid is a substance that dissociates in water to form hydrogen ions (H+)*
- *arrhenius base is a substance that dissociates in water to form hydroxide ions (OH-)*
- restricted to aqueous solutions and refer to the concentration of solvent ions

* Bronsted-Lowry Acid-Base Theory

- based on the acid's ability to cause protonation - donate hydrogen ions - to bases which accept them
- removal of hydrogen ion from an acid produces its conjugate base
  - conjugate base is the acid with hydrogen ion removed
- addition of proton to a base produces its conjugate acid
  - conjugate acid is the base with a hydrogen ion added
- acid and base thus react to form a new conjugate acid and a conjugate base - there is no concept of neutralization like other theories
- independent of solvent - wider application than arrhenius definition
- $HA + B \rightarrow BH^+ + A^-$
  - HA - acid
  - B base
  - BH+ conjugate acid
  - A- conjugate base

* Lewis Definition

- removed hydrogen requirement of other theories
- lewis acid can receive an electron pair
- lewis base can donate an electron pair
