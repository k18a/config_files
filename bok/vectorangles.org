#+TITLE: Angle Between Vectors
- consider two non zero vectors $[a], [b] \in [R^n]$
- angle between the two vectors is given as
\begin{equation}
cos \theta = \frac{[a].[b]}{|[a]||[b]|}
\end{equation}
- corollary
  - if [a] and [b] are orthagonal, their dot product is 0
  - [0] is orthagonal to all other vectors
