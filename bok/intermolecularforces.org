#+TITLE: Intermolecular Forces

* Intermolecular Forces

There are 3 types of intermolecular forces: 
1. dipole-dipole, 
2. dipole-induced-dipole, and 
3. dispersion.
 
* Dispersion Forces

Even if the net dipole moment in an atom or a molecule is 0 over a period of time, the charges are not symmetrically distributed at each instant, causing a net attractive force between two particles known as the dispersion force.
