#+TITLE: Heat Capacity

- denoted by C
- amount of heat required to increase temperature of one kilogram of a substance by 1 kelvin
- has units of J/K or $(kg*m^2)/(K*s^2)$
- extensive property; specific heat capacity, c, heat capacity per unit mass, is an intensive property

* Constant Volume Heat Capacity Cv 

From the fundamental equations: 

$dU = \partial Q + \partial W$

At constant volume

$C_v = (\frac{\partial U}{\partial T})_V = (\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T})_V$

- Cv is heat capacity at constant volume
- U is internal energy
- T is temperature
- V is volume
- Q is heat added/removed

For ideal gas: $C_v = \frac{1}{nR} T (\frac{\partial S}{\partial T})_V = \frac{1}{nR} (\frac{\partial U}{\partial T})_V$

- Cv is heat capacity at constant volume
- n is number of moles
- R is gas constant
- T is temperature
- S is entropy
- V is volume
- U us internal energy

Specific heat capacity at constant volume: 

$c_v = (\frac{\partial C}{\partial m})_V$

In engineering practice, cv often signifies volumetric heat capacity rather than constant volume heat capacity

* Constant Pressure Heat Capacity Cp

From fundamental equations: 

$dH = \partial Q + VdP$

At constant pressure

$C_P = (\frac{\partial H}{\partial T})_P = (\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T})_P$

- CP is heat capacity at constant volume
- H is enthalpy
- T is temperature
- V is volume
- Q is heat added/removed

For ideal gas: $C_p = \frac{1}{nR} T (\frac{\partial S}{\partial T})_P = \frac{1}{nR} (\frac{\partial H}{\partial T})_P = c_v + 1$

- Cp is heat capacity at constant pressure
- H is enthalpy, $H=U+PV$

Specific heat capacity at constant pressure

$c_P = (\frac{\partial C}{\partial m})_P$

* Relation Between Heat Capacities

it's easier to measure heat capacity at constant pressure than at constant volume, especially for liquids and solids where pressure required to maintain a constant volume can be significant

$C_p - C_v = VT \frac{\alpha ^2}{\beta _T}$

$c_p - c_v = \frac{\alpha ^2}{\sigma \beta _T}$

- $\alpha$ is the thermal expansion coefficient
- $\beta$ is the isothermal compressibility
- $\sigma$ is the density of the material

Isentropic expansion factor is the ratio between the constant volume and constant pressure heat capacity is denoted by: $\gamma = \frac{c_p}{c_v}$, which is 1.4 for air
