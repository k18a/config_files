#+TITLE: Calorimetry

* Calorimetric Methods for Pore Characterization
- pore characterization may also be accomplished using calorimetric methods, either by comparison of change in enthalpy of immersion with a standard sample, or by coating the sample with Ca, so the enthalpy of immersion is known cite:Sing1985
- calorimetry may also be accomplished with N2 or argon gas adsorption @Sing1985, or with thermoporometry cite:Sing1985
