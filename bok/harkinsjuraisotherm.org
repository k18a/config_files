#+TITLE: Harkins-Jura Isotherm

- multi-component isotherm based on Gibbs isotherm. EoS:
  - $\pi=b - a \sigma$, where a and b are constants.
- harkins-Jura Isotherm:
  - $$\frac{n}{n_{max}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{B}ln(\frac{1}{x})}}$$,
  - where x is the reduced pressure, $x=P/P_0$
- for the isotherm to have real solutions, $0\leq B \leq 3/2$.
- maximum adsorption is given by:
  - $n_{max} = \sqrt(\frac{C}{B})$
- it was found that for many systems, the square root of C is proportional to the surface area:
  - $S = 4.06 * \sqrt(C)$.
