* System

** Open System

** Closed System

- does not allow certain types of transfers: mass, energy, etc. 
- the specific limitations vary with field of study
- physics - no mass or momentum transfer
- thermodynamics - no mass transfer 
- chemistry - no mass transfer
- engineering - allows heat, mass, or momentum transfer but each input and output parameter is known

** Isolated System 

- in thermodynamics - no mass, heat, or momentum transfer

* Surroundings


* Control Volume

- fixed region in space

** Control Surface

- surface surrounding the control volume
