#+TITLE: Pore Geometry and Geo-Chemical Characteristics of Bowland Gas Shales

* Introruction

* Methodology 

** Samples

- shale reservoir samples from all stratigraphic units being considered fror exploration in the Bowland Basin, UK were acquired
- samples were crushed to a sieve size of 300-2000 \mu m
- crushed samples were washed with water and subsequently with acetone to remove entrenched oil
- they were then dried at 80 degC for nearly 12 hours and stored in air-tight containers in dark

*** Bowland Geology

** X-Ray Diffraction

** N2 Isotherm

- N2 isotherms were obtained from Quantachrome Autosorb IQ.
- about 0.1 to 0.2 g of the sample was weighed and transfered to the sample cell
- the sample was then outgassed in the rig; final weight was measured and fed into the system
- outgassing parameters
  | T (min) | Temp ( ^C) |
  |      60 |         50 |
  |      60 |        100 |
  |     300 |        120 |

*** Assumptions

- N2 boiling point - 77.35 K
- Non-ideality factor - 6.58 e-5 1/Torr
