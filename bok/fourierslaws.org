#+TITLE: Fourier's Laws

- law of heat conduction
- the time rate of heat transfer through a material is proportional to the negative gradient in the temperature and to the area at right angles to that gradient
- Newton's law of cooling is a discrete analogue of the Fourier's law
- [[file:ohmslaw.org][Ohm's law]] is the electrical analogue of Fourier's Law
* Integral Form
- looks at the amount of energy flowing into or out of a body as a whole
* Differential Form
- looks at rate of energy flow or flux
