#+TITLE: Galerikin Method
- an approximate numerical solution to a partial differential function is constructed as a linear combination of basis functions, $\phi _j$ in a finite dimensional sub space - sum of coefficients times basis functions, leading to the formulation of a matrix equation, which is solved by standard methods from linear algebra.
\begin{equation}
u(x,t) \approx U(x,t) = \Sigma _{j=1} ^N \epsilon _j \phi _j (x,t)
\end{equation}
- the basis function is defined as 1 when $x=x_j$, and 0 for all other values of x
\begin{equation}
\phi_j = 1, x = x_j; 
\phi_j = 0, x \neq x_j
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x = [\epsilon _j]^N _j = 1
\end{equation}
- the coefficients are deterimed based on the [[file:weakformulation.org][weak solution]] to the PDE
- this allows us to define the [[file:vectornorm.org][L2 product]] of the functions with associated norm, and orthagonality - key to FEM
\begin{equation}
(v,w) = S
\end{equation}
