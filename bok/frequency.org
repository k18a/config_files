#+TITLE: Frequency

- $c = \lambda * \gamma$, where c is velocity, $\lambda$ is wavelength and $\gamma$ is frequency
- faster waves travel faster
- every pitch a musical instrument plays has a core frequency
- frequencies are measured in Hertz
* Sound Equalizer
+ alters the loundness of each frequency in a music to suit one's musical taste
+ try starting with subtraction rather than increasing sounds of diferent frequencies
  - this allows you to filter out unpleasant sounds that you do not want in your music
** Controlable Parameters

*** Bandwidth (Q)
 - how wide a swath of frequency you'll be affecting
*** Shelf/Notch
 - notch mode offers all control points
 - shelf mode eliminates all frequencies below it
** Controlled Frequencies
** Bass
- contains bass instruments such as drums

- most bass instruments reside in this region
*** 125 Hz
