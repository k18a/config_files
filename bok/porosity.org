#+TITLE: Porosity

- it's the ratio of void space volume to the bild volume of a given material
- porosity measured by a given method is the ratio of the total pore volume $V_p$ to the apparent volume V of the particle or powder, excluding interparticle voids, $/epsilon = V_p/V$ cite:Sing1985
- porosity of shales increases when treated with CO2-saturated brine solution due to decomposition of carbonate minerals cite:Lu1995
- $PV = BV - GV$
  - PV is pore volume
  - BV is bulk volume
  - GV is grain volume
- $\phi = PV/BV$
- $\phi = (BV-GV)/BV$
  - \phi is porosity
- effective porosity is a measure of the connected voids 
  - excluding isolated pores
  - does not include the volume of clay-bound or mineral-bound water
  - does not include additional water held within the shale by capillary forces
- total porosity is a measure both connected and isolated void space
  - also includes volume occupied by all fluids
- for most reservoir rocks, the difference between effective and total porosity is negligible cite:API2010
  - effective porosity determined at 99 degC to 116 degC more closely corresponds to total porosity value cite:API2010
* Porosity Determination
** Bulk volume
*** Archemides (Buoyancy)
**** Mercury
- a core plug is immersed in mercury and the volume of mercury displaced is determined gravimetrically
**** Other Fluids
*** Mercury Displacement
*** Caliper
*** Boyle's Law
*** Liquid Saturation
** Organic Rich Rocks with Adsorption Capacity
