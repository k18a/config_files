* Enthalpy

- capacity to do non-mechanical work plus the capacity to release heat
\begin{equation}
H = U + PV
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
dH = \partial Q + VdP
\end{equation}
- an extensive property
*** Special Cases
For an ideal gas
$H(S,P,N) = c_p N k (\frac{P \phi}{k} e^{S/Nk})^{1/c_p}$
- H is enthalpy
- S is entropy
- cp is heat capacity at constant pressure
- N is number of moles
- V is volume
- $\phi$ is a constant independent of the thermodynamic state if the gas, with the dimensions of $VTc_v/N$
- k is boltzmann constant = 1.381e-23 J/K
