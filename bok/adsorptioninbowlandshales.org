#+TITLE: Effect of Reservoir Temperature, Pressure, Geo-chemistry, and Pore-structure on Gas Shale Adsorption Characteristics and Reservoir Producibility

* Introduction

- cite:Andrews2013 used adsorption characteristics for it's bottom up estimate of TGIIP, as data was unavailable for Bowland formations

* Methodology

** Sample Description

- shale samples from all prospective stratigraphic units in the Bowland region have been analysed
- samples with a distribution of Total Organic Content and inorganic mineral composition were selected to capture the effect of shale composition on its adsorption characteristics
- sample's pore structure is discussed elsewhere 

- samples were crushed to a sieve size between 350 \mu m and 2000 \mu m for adsorption measurement
- about 30 ml of the sample (same as the free volume of the sample cell) was taken for analysis - depending on shale density, this corresponds to about 20 - 40 g for different stratigraphic units
- crushed samples were stored in dark under air-tight containers

** Manometric Adsorption Measurement

  
* Results

* Discussions

- due to the effects of hysteresis, using adsorption isotherms for reservoir simulation might over-predict reservoir production
