** Theory 
- it's best to use the simplest model that suits a given purpose, both to undue emphasis on the fine points of theory often tends to obscure what's really going on.

* Diffusion  
- gas production from shales involves 3 steps cite:Crosdale1998:
  - Darcy flow in natural and hydraulic fractures,
  - Knudsen diffusion in nano-pores, and
  - Gas desorption in nano-pores.
- the rate determining step is diffusion in nano-pores cite:Crosdale1998
- diffusion in shales is a complex process; consequently most models attempting to characterise this phenomenon are approximate cite:Ruckenstein1971
- in laboratory experiments, the adsorption process involves cite:Qiu2009
  - film diffusion - in the fluid film
  - intra-particle diffusion - along pore walls
  - mass-action - ad/desorption on the active sites in pores
- mass-action is instantaneous for physisorption; one of the other two steps is usually rate determining cite:Qiu2009
- models used to fit experimental kinetic data often fail to consider if the boundary conditions assumed by the model are valid to the given experimental conditions cite:Qiu2009

* Reservoir Simulation
* Geology
- CO2 production in coals can be due to interactions between coal water and an igneous rock, although significant amounts of CO2 related to non-igneous activity maybe present cite:Crosdale1998

* Enhanced Recovery
- Gas injection may increase methane recovery from shale r  (setq-default dotspacemacs-line-numbers t)
eservoirs by one of the two mechanisms cite:Clarkson2000: 
  1) lowering methane partial pressure in free gas 
  2) competitive adsorption
