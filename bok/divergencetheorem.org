#+TITLE: Divergence Theorem
- over a region D with boundary $\partial D$
\begin{equation}
\int _{\partial D} P(x,y) dx + Q(x,y) dy = 
\int \int _D (\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}) dx dy
\end{equation}
- we are thus able to relate a line integral (left side) with a surface integral (right side)
