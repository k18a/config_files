* Natural Variables

- variables that are held constant in a process
- a thermodynamic potential can be derived as a function of its natural variables
- consider the fundamental relation $U = f(S,V)$, 
  - where U is the internal energy, 
- by performing [[file:legendretransformation.org][legendre transformation]], we can get a new function, $F = g(T,V)$; 
- S,V are natural variables for U, whilst T,V are natural variables for F
- if a thermodynamic potential can be determined as a function of its natural variables, 
- all of the thermodynamic properties of the system can be found 
  - by taking the partial derivatives of that potential with respect to its natural variables; 
- conversely, if the thermodynamic potential is not given as a function of its natural variables, 
  - it will not yield all the thermodynamic properties of the system
