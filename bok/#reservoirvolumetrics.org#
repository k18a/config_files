#+TITLE: Reservoir Volumetrics
- reservoir volumetric analysis is used to determine volume from static information that remains constant over a period of time
- Original Oil in Place (OOIP)
  - $N = \frac{7758 \phi A h_o S_{oi}}{B_{oi}}$
    - N is original oil in place (STB)
    - \phi is reservoir porosity
    - A is reservoir area (acres)
    - h_o is net thickness of oil zone (feet)
    - $S_{oi}$ is initial reservoir oil saturation
    - $B_{oi}$ is oil formation volume factor (RB/STB)
- Original Free Gas in Place
  - $G = \frac{7758 \phi A h_g S_{gi}}{B_{gi}}$
    - G is original gas in place (SCF)
    - \phi is reservoir porosity
    - A is reservoir area (acres)
    - h_g is net thickness of gas zone (feet)
    - $S_{gi}$ is initial reservoir gas saturation
    - $B_{gi}$ is gas formation volume factor (RB/STB)
- the reservoir is modeled by subdividing the reservoir volume into an array or grid of smaller volume elements - gridblock, cell, or node
- bulk volume V_b of each gridblock defined in a cartesian co-ordinate system {x,y,z} is calculated from the gross thickness \Delta z = h of each gridblock and the gridblock lengths \Delta x and \Delta y
  - $V_B = h \Delta x \Delta y$
- gridblock pore volume is calculated as
  - $V_P = \phi \eta V_B = \phi \eta h \Delta x \Delta y = \phi h_{net} \Delta x \Delta y$
  - where \phi is porosity and \eta is net-to-gross ratio and $h_{net}$ is net thickness
- volume phase is pore volume times the saturation
  - $V_l = S_l * V_P = S_l \phi h_{net} \Delta x \Delta y$
- this estimate from a bottom-up approach can be validated based on volumetrics calculated from other sources such as a material balance study or a computer mapping package
* Material Balance
- provide an independent method of estimating the volume of oil, water, and gas in a reservoir for compariso with volumetric estimates
- magnitues of various factors in a material balance equation indicates the relative contribution of different drive mechanisms at work in the reservoir
- can be used to predict future reservoir performance and aid in estimating cumulative recovery efficiency

- where
  - $D_o = (B_t - B_{ti})$
  - $D_{go} = N m B_{ti} (\frac{B_{gc} - B_{gi}}{B _{gi}})$
  - $D_w = \frac{B_{ti} S_{wio}}{1-S_{wio}} (\frac{B_{tw} - B_{twi}}{B _{twi}})$
  - $D_{gw} = \frac{m B_{ti} S_{wig}}{1-S_{wig}} (\frac{B_{tw} - B_{twi}}{B _{twi}})$

  - the left-hand-side term accounts for changes in volume
  - terms on the right hand side account for fluid production and injection
*** Gas Reservoir
- $G B_{gi} = N m B _{ti}$
- substituting into the oil reservoir material balance equation and accounting for the fact that water compressibility and formation compressibility are negligible compared to gas compressibility
- $$G B_{gi} (\frac{B_{gc} - B_{gi}}{B_{gi}}) = [G _{pc} B _{gc} - G _t B _g'] - (W _e + W _i - W _p) B _w$$
