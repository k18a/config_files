#+TITLE: Langmuir Theory

- Langmuir equation reduces to Henry's law isotherm at very low pressures

* Assumptions

- the Langmuir model assumes that cite:Langmuir1918
  1) the surface is energetically homogeneous,
  2) the adsorbate is present in definite localised sites, and 
  3) each site can contain only one molecule 
- an ideal surface has a periodic energy fluctuation larger than the thermal energy of the molecule, with the troughs acting as adsorption sites cite:Do1998
- the following criteria need to be met for Langmuir theory to be applicable instead of potential theory cite:Clarkson1999
  1) Surface is energetically homogeneous, 
  2) Monolayer volume, and hence slope of Langmuir plot is temperature invariant, and 
  3) Fitting parameter decreases exponentially with temperature. 

* Derivation

- the Langmuir theory of adsorption, originally derived based on a kinetic principle, assumes that the rates of adsorption and desorption are equal at equilibrium cite:Do1998
- the number of molecules adsorbed is given by the rate of striking from the kinetic theory of gas, multiplied by the striking coefficient, $\alpha$, and the fraction of empty adsorption sites, $(1-\theta)$: $R_a = (1 - \theta) * \frac{\alpha P}{\sqrt{2 \pi M R_g T}}$ 
- the number of molecules desorbed is given by: $R_d = k_{d \infty} exp(-\frac{E_d}{R_g T})\theta$
where $k_{d\infty}$ is the rate constant for desorption at infinite temperature
- equating the two, the Langmuir equation is obtained:
  - $$\theta = \frac{b*P}{1+b*P}$$ 
    - where b, the affinity constant is given by:
      - $b = \frac{\alpha exp(Q/R_g T)}{k_{d\infty}\sqrt{2 \pi M R_g T}} = b_\infty exp(Q/R_g T)$
- Langmuir equation with a different representation
  - $$q = \frac{V_L*P}{P_L + P}$$
  - q is amount adsorbed
  - V_L is the Langmuir volume 
    - this is also known as q_e - the amount adsorbed at equilibrium
  - P is the pressure or concentration
  - Q^0 is Langmuir volume
  - P_L is the Langmuir pressure
    - Langmuir pressure is the inverse of the affinity constant
    - $P_L = \frac{1}{b}$
- the affinity constant at a given temperature is related to the affinity constant at infinite temperature, $b_\infty$, as: $b(T) = b_{\infty} exp(\frac{Q}{R_g T})$.
  - the affinity constant does not vary with fractional loading for Langmuir cite:Do1998
  - where Q = the heat of adsorption and is equal to the activation energy for desorption
  - Q is positive and therefore adsorption is an exothermic process
  - since adsorption is accompanied by a decrease in free energy, and entropy (as molecules are getting more orderly), the associated enthalpy change is negative $\Delta H = \Delta G + T\Delta S < 0$; adsorption is an exothermic process cite:Do1998
  - differentiating the Langmuir equation and substituting into the van't Hoff equation gives the equation for isosteric heat of adsorption for the Langmuir model @Do1998: $-\Delta H = Q + \frac{\delta R_g T^2}{(1-\theta)}$
  - where the thermal expansion coefficient of the saturation concentration $\delta = -\frac{1}{C_{\mu s}}\frac{dC_{\mu s}}{dT}$
  - for Langmuir, the thermal expansion of the saturation concentration, $\delta = 0$ if $\Delta H$ is finite at high coverage cite:Do1998

- linear form of Langmuir equation
- $\frac{P}{q_e} = \frac{P}{Q_0} + \frac{1}{Q^0 * b}$
  - q_e is the amount adsorbed at equilibrium
    - this is also known as the Langmuir volume V_L
  - P is the pressure or concentration
  - Q^0 is Langmuir volume
  - b is the affinity constant
    - Langmuir pressure is the inverse of the affinity constant
    - $P_L = \frac{1}{b}$

* Super-critical Langmuir Model

- a variant of Langmuir for super-critical applications cite:Gasparik2014:
  - $$n_{excess} = n_L \frac{p}{p+p_L(T)}(1-\frac{\rho_g(p,T)}{\rho_a})$$
    - where $n_L$ is the Langmuir volume
    - $p_L$ is the langmuir pressure
    - $\rho_g$ is the gas phase density 
    - $\rho_a$ is the adsorbate phase density

* Bi-Langmuir Model

- cite:Lu1995 proposed a variant of the Langmuir model, taking into account the different adsorption characteristics of kerogens and clay minerals:
  - $\frac{n_{ads}}{N_m} = f_1 \frac{k_1(T)p}{1+k_1(T)p} + (1-f_1)\frac{k_2(T)p}{1+k_2(T)p}$
