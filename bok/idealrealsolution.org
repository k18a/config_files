#+TITLE: Ideal Solution

* Solution

- homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances
- has a positive [[file:entropy.org][entropy]] of mixing

* Ideal Solution 

- mean strength of interactions are the same between all the molecules of the solution: $2U_{AB} = U_{AA} + U_{BB}$
- longer range interactions are indistinguishable
- thermodynamic properties of the mixture are analogous to ideal gases
- enthalpy of mixing is 0
- closer the enthalpy of mixing is to 0, the more ideal the solution
- volume change on mixing is 0: $V = \Sigma V_i$
- change in Gibbs free energy is determined solely by the entropy of mixing: $\Delta G = RT \Sigma x_i ln(x_i)$
- [[file:vapourpressure.org][vapour pressure]] of the solution obeys [[file:raoultslaw.org][Raoult's law]]
- [[file:activitycoefficient.org][activity coefficient]] of each component is equal to 1
- solutions of molecules that are chemically almost identical (ex.: 1-butanol and 2-butanol) will be almost ideal

* Real Solution

- deviations from ideality can be described using a Margules function or [[file:activitycoefficient.org][activity coefficients]]
