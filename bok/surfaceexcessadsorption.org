#+TITLE: Surface Excess Adsorption

* Adsorption Characterization
- analysis methodology, adopted after cite:rouquerol1994, is outlined below
[[./adsorption_workflow.jpg]]
- samples were loaded on to the adsorption rig, and the rig was flushed with Helium several times to remove any residual gas from previous experiments
- samples were then outgassed in-situ at 90 degC and 150 Torr pressure
- after outgassing the rig was brought down to experimental temperature and allowed to reach equilibrium at about 500 Torr pressure
- performing outgassing in-situ in an inert near-vacuum atmosphere allows us to minimize any exposure to air, moisture, or any other adsorptive that might otherwise affect our measurements
- adsoprtion and desorption was measured through a step-wise procedure as outlined in the diagram
- the reference and sample cells are isolated; adsorptive is injected into the reference cell and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium; the sample valve is then opened and the rig pressure was monitored for 2 hours or until equilibrium conditions were met, whichever was longer
- initial # moles in the sample cell is using an appropriate Equation of State
\begin{equation}
n_{is} = EOS(P_{s},V_{v},T_{s})
\end{equation}
- where
  - $n_{is}$ is number of moles initially present in the sample cell before experiment
  - EOS is a function denoting the chosen Equation of State
  - $P_s$ is sample cell pressure
  - $V_v$ is sample cell void volume
  - $T_s$ is sample cell temperature
- sample cell void volume is calculated as
\begin{equation}
V_v = V_s - V_{sp} * w_{sh}
\end{equation}
- where
  - $V_v$ is sample cell void volume
  - $V_s$ is sample cell volume
  - $V_{sp}$ is sample specific volume
  - $w_{sh}$ is sample weight
- injected # moles is calculated as
\begin{equation}
n_{ir} = EOS(P_{r,f},V_r,T_r) - EOS(P_{r,i},V_r,T_r)
\end{equation}
- where
  - $n_{ir}$ is number of moles injected
  - EOS is a function denoting the chosen Equation of State
  - $P_{r,f}$ is final pressure of reference cell
  - $P_{r,i}$ is initial pressure of reference cell
  - $V_r$ is reference cell volume
  - $T_r$ is reference cell temperature
- # moles present at any given instance is calculated as
\begin{equation}
n_{c} = EOS(P_s,V_r,V_v,T_s)
\end{equation}
  - $n_{c}$ is number of moles injected
  - EOS is a function denoting the chosen Equation of State
  - $P_{s}$ is final pressure of reference cell
  - $P_{s}$ is initial pressure of reference cell
  - $V_r$ is reference cell volume
  - $V_v$ is sample cell volume
  - $T_s$ is sample cell temperature
- excess adsobed # moles for the nth pressure step is calculated as 
\begin{equation}
n_{ex} = n_{ir}(1) + n_{ir}(2) + \dots + n_{ir}(n) + n_{is} - n_c
\end{equation}
- where
  - $n_{ir}(n)$ is amount of moles injected at nth pressure step

* Gibbs Dividing Surface
- the Gibbs Dividing Surface (GDS) is an arbirtary geometrical surface close to the adsorbing surface, with a precisely determined position
  - it is assumed that adsorption takes place on the GDS

** Gibbs Exclusion Volume
- Gibbs Exclusion Volume $V_{GDS}$ is the volume excluded by the GDS cite:Rouquerol2016
  - by declaring such a variable, it is possible to exclude the uncertainties posed by void volume calculations from the surface excess amount
  - but this also means that the Gibbs Exclusion Volume must be reported along with the surface excess for it to be comparable  
    
** Choice of the GDS
- due to practical limitations are limited to the following cite:Rouquerol2016
  - a probe-determined $V_{GDS}$ close to the adsorbent specific volume $V _i ^s$ for vapour adsorption below 1 bar
  - an arbirtray $V_{GDS}$ of 0.5 cm3/g, which is close enough to the specific volume of many adsorbents
  - $V_{GDS}$ of 0, yeilds net adsorption, particularly useful for evaluating gas storage

* Specific Volume of the Sample
- dead volume is the volume available to the gas phase cite:Rouquerol2016
  - $V _i ^g = V - ( V _i ^S + V _i ^a)$
  - V is the sum of the volume of the empty adsorption bulb + the dosing volume up to the membrane of the pressure transducer
    - $V _i ^S$ is the adsorbent volume inaccessible to the molecules of the adsorptive i - the solid volume
    - $V _i ^a$ is the volume of the adsorption space for the adsorptive i - the adsoptive volume
  - the usual method of void volume characterization is based on gas expansion using Helium, which is assumed to inert  
    - it is now well known that He is, however, prone, to adsorption in micropores, leading to disproprtionately large void volumes and disproportionately small values for adsorption cite:Rouquerol2016
    - He absorption might also be appreciable for shales, especially at moisture equilibrated conditions
    - this effect maybe minimized by measuring dead volume at higher temperatures cite:Rouquerol2016 
    - due to their dimensions, some of these pores might be inaccessible to larger adsorptive molecules.
    - these shortcomings can be in principle avoided by calculating void volume through gas expansion of the adsorptive molecules at a tempreature where adsorption is negligible, but this is not always practically possible cite:Rouquerol2016
    - in simulations, the dead volume is calculated using an r-distance surface, the volume limited by the probe-accessible surface - the connolly surface for spherical probes cite:Rouquerol2016
    - [[./voidvolumecalculation.jpg]] 

* Adsorption Space
- adsorption space is $V _i ^a$ defined as the region in which the concentration of the adsorptive is higher compared to the bulk region or the gas phase cite:Rouquerol2016
  - for the sake of simplicity, the adsorption space is often taken as 0 cite:Rouquerol2016
  - adsorbed phase volume, $V _i ^a$ can either cite:Rouquerol2016
    - be assumed to be equal to the micropore volume - with increasing density with loading, or
    - be assumed to have a constant density and increasing volume with loading

- amount adsorbed is defined as the content of the adsorption space cite:Rouquerol2016

* Excess Adsorption
- the resulting surface excess amount is given as: cite:Rouquerol2016
  - $n _\sigma = n - c^g (V - V _{GDS})$
    - n is the total adsorptive introduced into the system
    - cg is the final experimental concentration of the gas phase
    - $V _{GDS} is the gibbs exclusion volume that is decided by the coice of the GDS
  - it must be noted that most porous solids do not have a well defined adospriton surface, and hence the defenition of a Gibbs surface excess is not valid in most cases; however the concept of a surface excess amount can be an useful intermediate step in calculating  amount adsorbed.
    - in adsorbates containing micropores less than 2 nm, dead volume of the gas phase is not very easy to measure.
    - a straight line or plane assumed to be the GDS cannot conicde with the more complex shape of the adsorptive-accessibe surface of the adsorbent.
    - it can be seen that for different arbitrary GDS positions, the excess adsorbed, $n _{\sigma}$, calculated varies accordingly
      - the space represented by the yellow rectangle is the portion of gas counted as gas
      - where $n^a$ is the absolute adsorption
      - $n ^{\sigma} = n^a - n^c - n^b$ for GDS-1
      - $n ^{\sigma} = n^a - n^c$ for GDS-2
      - $n ^{\sigma} = n^a + n^d$ for GDS-3

* Net Adsorption
- net adsorption is calculated from a $V_{GDS}$ of 0 cite:Rouquerol2016

* Absolute Adsorption
- calculation of absolute adsorption requires knowledge of cite:Rouquerol2016
  - $V_{GDS}$ used to calculate $n ^{\sigma}$
  - gas law used the calculation of $n ^{\sigma}$ to derive $c ^g$
  - specific inaccessible volume of the adsorbent $V _i ^s$
  - actual volume of the adsorbate $V _i ^a$
- $$n ^a = n ^{\sigma} + c ^g V ^a + c ^g ( V _i ^S - V _{GDS} )$$ cite:Rouquerol2016

** Adsorbed Phase Volume / Density Correction Term
- $c ^g V ^a$
- second term in the equation for absolute adsorption corrects the assumption of 0 adsorption volume in the Gibbs approach
  - for sub-critical adsorption below 1 bar this term might be ignored
  - but this term becomes significant for adsorption above 10 bars and for super-critical adsorption
** Void Volume Correction Term
- $c ^g ( V _i ^S - V _{GDS} )$
- thrid term accounts for the fact that GDS does not coincide with the adsorbing surface accessible to the adsorbate
- can be ignored for low pressures due to low values fo $c ^g$
  - for high pressure adsorption, due to an increased value of $c ^g$, small errors in $V _i ^s$ and $V _i ^a$ lead to a significant error in amount adsorbed
- for vapour adsorption at low pressures, below 1 bar, the difference between excess and absolute adsopriton is negligible. 

* Equations of State
- the choice of equation of state, greatly affects calculated adsorption values
  - whilst conventional equations such as Peng-Robinson and Redlich-Kwong are widely used, more precise EoS specific for individual gases have been proposed in the recent years.
- it is challenging to find an EoS that adequately describes adsorption at near critical regions cite:Siemons2007

* Leak Rates
- despite significant efforts it is not uncommon to experience a very small leak in home-made manometric adsorption measurement rigs
- long-durations required to reach equilibrium, coupled with small adsorption capacities for shales, imply that even small leak rates can have a significant effect on the calculated amount adsorbed
- leak rates for gases are modeled as a flow through an orrifice using the Hagan-Poiseuille law assuming a laminar flow
\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{\pi R^4 (P_1 ^2 - P_2 ^2)}{16 \eta l P_2}
\end{equation}
- Q is the volumetric flow of the outlet side pressure (atmospheric pressure)
- P_1 is the rig pressure
- P_2 is atmospheric pressure
- R is radius of opening
- l is length of opening
- \eta is the viscosity of the fluid
- leak rates for non-compressible fluid such as water, oil, etc. is modelled using the following equation
\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{\pi R^4 (P_1 - P_2)}{8 \eta l}
\end{equation}

* Saturation Vapour Pressure
- saturation Vapour Pressure has been obtained through
  - Antoine equation
\begin{equation}
ln P_0 = \beta _1 - \frac{\beta _2}{T}
\end{equation}
  - a plot of log(vapour pressure) vs 1/T cite:Clarkson1997
  - from Chemical Engineering data books cite:Lide2003
  - from reduced Kirchoff equation cite:Kapoor1989
    - $P _s = P _c * exp[ \frac{T _{nbp}}{T _c} (\frac{ln P _c}{1 - T _{nbp}/T _c})(1 - \frac{T _c}{T}) ]$
  - from Dubinin equation cite:Kapoor1989, cite:Amankwah1995
    - $P_s = (\frac{T}{T_c})^2 P_c$
  - from modified Dubinin equation cite:Amankwah1995
    - $P_s = (\frac{T}{T_c})^k P_c$
- cite:Clarkson1997 found that pseudo vapour pressures obtained from CRC handbook and Kirchoff equation provided the best results.

* Adsorbed Phase Density
- several assumptions have been made in the literature
  - adsorbed phase density equals liquid density at boiling poing
    - for methane at -162 degC: 422.6 kg/m3 (2218 mol/m3)
  - adsorbed phase density is higher than liquid density

- data for liquid-like behavior of the adsorbed phase was first provided by Gurvitch 1915 for meso-porous substances exhibiting capillary condensation cite:Do1998. However Dubinin found that density of sorbed phase in micro-porous substances microporous substances might be higher by a factor of 1.5. cite:Do1998. However in the absence of further information, it is reasonable to assume that sorbed phase behaves like a liquid in micro-porous substances.

* Gravimetric Adsorption
- in gravimetric measurements, the effect of weight increase due to adsorption is reduced due to bouyancy, proportional to gas density $\rho _i ^g$ cite:Rouquerol2016
- excess adsorbed is given as:
  - $n ^{\sigma} = \frac{\Delta m + \Delta \rho _i ^g (V _{GDS} + V ^B)}{M_i}$
    - for gravimetric measurements, $c ^g$ can be replaced by $\rho _i ^g$ / M_i$
    - $\Delta m$ is the measured mass change
    - $\rho _i ^g$ is the gas phase density
    - $V _{GDS}$ is the Gibbs exclusion volume
    - $V ^B$ is the volume of the gas phase
    - $M _i$ is the molar mass of the adsorptive
- absolute adsorbed is given as
  - $n ^a = n ^{\sigma} + (\frac{\Delta \rho _i ^g}{M _i}) V _i ^a + (\frac{\Delta \rho _i ^g}{M _i})*(V _i ^s - V_{GDS})$
    - $V _i ^a$ is the volume of the adsorbed phase
