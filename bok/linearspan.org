#+TITLE: Linear Span
- a set of all vectors that could be created as a [[file:linearcombinationvector.org][linear combination]] of those vectors
- linear span of a set of vectors in a linear subspace is the intersection of all linear subspaces which each contain every vector in that set
- the linear span of a vector space is therefore a vector space
- given a vector space V over a field K, the span of a set S of vectors is defined to be the intersection W of all subspaces that contain S
- W is referred to as the subspace spanned by S or by the vectors in S, S is the spanning set of W (S spans W)
\begin{equation}
W = span(S) = {\Sigma _{i=1} ^k \lambda _i v _i | k \in N _i, v _i \in S, \lambda _i \in K}
\end{equation}
- if S is a finite subset of V then span of S is the set of all linear combinations of the elements of S
- in case of infinite S, inifinite linear combinations are excluded by the definition
- the span of [0] is just the [0] vector itself
- to span all of $[R^n]$, you just need 2 vectors that are not colinear
- simplest 2 vectors that can span the whole $[R^n]$ is 
\begin{equation}
[i] = \begin{matrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{matrix} 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
[j] = \begin{matrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{matrix}
\end{equation}
