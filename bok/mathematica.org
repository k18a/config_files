* ND Frame
- framework for solving differential equations
- Numerical Differential Equation Solver
- can solve ODEs, PDEs, boundary value problems etc.
- output is in the form of a interpolating function, but calculations are carried out numerically

- general syntax for solving NDSolve 
#+BEGIN_SRC wolfram
NDSolve[eqns, vars, {t,tmin,tmax}]
#+END_SRC

- eqns contain the actual equation and a set of initial conditions
- vars first contain dependent variables followed by independent variables
