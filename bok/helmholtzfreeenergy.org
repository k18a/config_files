* Helmholtz Free Energy

- uses symbols A (IUPAC) or F (general physics)
- capacity to do mechanical work plus non-mechanical work
- thermodynamic potential that measures useful work obtainable from a closed thermodynamic system at constant temperature and volume
- the negative of the change in helmholtz energy during a process is the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a thermodynamic process with constant volume; if volume is not held constant, part of this work is performed as boundary work
- at constant temperature, the Helmholtz free energy is minimized at equilibrium
- it is the Legendre transform of the internal energy U, in which temperature replaces entropy as the independent variable

* Formulation

$A = U - TS$

- A is Helmholtz free energy
- U is internal energy
- T is absolute temperature
- S is entropy

* Derivation

Based on the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system: 

$\partial U = \partial Q + \partial W$

- U is internal energy
- $\partial Q$ is the energy added as heat
- $\partial W$ is the work done

Second law of thermodynamics for a [reversibleprocess](reversibleprocess): 

$\partial Q = T dS$

- $\partial Q$ is the energy added as heat
- T is absolute temperature
- S is entropy

For a reversible process, ignoring non-PV work, such as electrical work: 

$\partial W = - p dV$ 

- $\partial W$ is the work done
- p is the pressure
- V is the volume
 
Applying [[file:productrule.org][product rule]] for differentiation: 

$d(TS) = TdS + SdT$

- T is absolute temperature
- S is entropy

$d(U-TS) = -SdT - pdV$

- U is internal energy
- T is absolute temperature
- S is entropy
- p is the pressure
- V is the volume

Since, $A = U-TS$, 

$dA = -SdT - pdV$
 
- A is Helmholtz free energy
- T is absolute temperature
- S is entropy
- p is the pressure
- V is the volume

### Special Cases

For an ideal gas

$A(T,V,N) = NkT (c_v - ln(\frac{VTc_v}{N \phi}))$

- A is Helmholtz free energy
- T is temperature
- V is volume
- N is number of particles
- k is [boltzmannconstant](boltzmannconstant)
- cv is heat capacity at constant volume
- $\phi$ is a constant independent of the thermodynamic state if the gas, with the dimensions of $VTc_v/N$
