#+TITLE: Pseudo-First Order Diffusion Model

- earliest model pertaining to adsorption rate based on adsorption capacity
- called pseudo first order equation to distinguish it from kinetic equations
- initially proposed by Lagergren in 1898
- $\frac{dq_t}{dt} = k_1 * (q_e - q_t)$
  - q_t is amount adsorbed at time t
  - k_2 is pseudo second order rate constant
  - q_e is amount adsorbed at equilibrium
- with boundary conditions:
  - $q_t = 0$ at $t = 0$
  - $q_t = q_t$ at $t = t$
  - $q_t = q_e$ at $t = \infty$
- $ln(\frac{q_e}{q_e - q_t} = k_1 t$
- $log(q_e - q_t) = log(q_e) - \frac{k_1}{2.303} * t$
