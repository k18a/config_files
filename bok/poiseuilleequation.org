#+TITLE: Hagen-Poiseuille Equation

- relates pressure drop of an incompressible Newtonian fluid flopwing though a long cylindrical pupe of constant cross-section
- $\Delta P = \frac{8 \mu L Q}{\pi R ^4}$
  - \Delta P is the pressure difference between two ends
  - L is length of pipe
  - \mu is dynamic viscosity
  - Q is volumetric flow rate
  - R is pipe radius

* Drawbacks

- for turbulent flows, pressure drop is larger than that calculated by Hagen-Poiseuille equation
- the equation does not hold close to pipe entrance
- the equation fails for low-viscosity, wide, and short pipes
- for such cases more complex models such as the Darcy-Weisbach equation need to be used
