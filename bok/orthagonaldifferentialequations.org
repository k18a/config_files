#+TITLE: Orthagonal Differential Equations

* Applications
- electricity
  - lines of equal potential in a plane sheet conducting electricity are orthagonal trajectories

* Method to find Orthagonal Trajectories

- find differential equation of the family of curves
- replace dy/dx with -dx/dy as product of the slope of orthagonal trajectories is -1
- solve the new differential equation

- it's often convenient to reporesent orthagonal trajectories as polar co-ordinates
