* Thermal Expansion Coefficient

- denoted by $\alpha _V$
- describes fractional change in volume per degree change in temperature at constant pressure
- volumetric thermal expansion coefficient is the most basic of thermal expansion coefficients, and most relevant for fluids
- [isotropic](isotropic) materials expand at the same rate in every direction

$\alpha _V = \frac{1}{V}(\frac{\partial V}{\partial T})_P$

- $\alpha _V$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion
- V is volume
- T is temperature
- P is pressure
