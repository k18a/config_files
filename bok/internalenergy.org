* Internal Energy

- represented by U
- the capacity to do work plus the capacity to release heat
- all thermodynamic potentials can be derived from the [[file:internalenergy.org][internal energy]], U based on [[file:legendretransformation.org][legendre transformation]]

** Formulation

$U = \int (TdS - pdV + \sum \mu _i dN_i)$

- U is internal energy
- T is absolute temperature
- S is entropy
- p is the pressure
- V is the volume
- $\mu$ is the chemical potential

** Derivation 

From [[file:lawsofthermodynamics.org][first law of thermodynamics]]

$dU = \partial Q + \partial W$

- U is internal energy
- $\partial Q$ is the energy added as heat
- $\partial W$ is the work done

Second law of thermodynamics

$\partial Q = T dS$

- $\partial Q$ is the energy added as heat
- T is absolute temperature
- S is entropy

Work done is given by

$\partial W = PdV$

Substituting second law into the first law

$dU = TdS - PdV$

Including amounts of chemical components Ni

$dU = TdS - PdV + \sum \mu _i dn_i$

This is often known as the fundamental thermodynamic equation

*** Special Forms

If the system has external parameters X so that the volume is not constant

$dU = TdS - \sum X_j dx_j + \sum \mu _i dn_i$

For an ideal gas

$U(S,V,N) = c_v N k (\frac{N \phi}{V} e^(S/Nk))^{1/c_v}$

- U is internal energy
- S is entropy
- cv is heat capacity at constant volume
- N is number of moles
- V is volume
- $\phi$ is a constant independent of the thermodynamic state if the gas, with the dimensions of $VTc_v/N$
- k is boltzmann constant = 1.381e-23 J/K
