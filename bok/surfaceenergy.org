#+TITLE: Surface Energy

- occurs in all interfaces between two phases
- surface energy is the excess energy at the surface of a material compared to the bulk
- surfaces are intrinsically less energetically favourable than the bulk of a material
- surface energy quantifies the disruption of intermolecular bonds that occur when a surface is created
  - work required to cut a bulk sample creating two surfaces
- if the creation of surface is reversible, cutting a solid to give two surfaces implies that surface energy is half the energy of cohesion
  - this is true only for freshly prepared surfaces in vacuum
- unit of surface tension
  - milli-Newtons per meter or dynes per centimeter

| surface tension | interfacial tension | surface free energy |
| liquid-gas      | liquid-liquid       | solid-fluid    |

* Interfacial Tension
- interfacial tension for different fluids
| fluid pair | IFT (mN/m or dyne per cm) |
| air-brine  |                    72-100 |
| oil-brine  |                     15-40 |
| gas-oil    |                     35-65 |
- interfacial tension maybe estimated using the Macleod-Sugden correlation
** Macleod-Sugden Correlation
- Weinaug-Katz variation of the Macleod-Sugdon correlation
- $$\sigma = \Sigma _{i=1} ^N P _{chi} (x _i \frac{\rho _L}{M _L} - y _i \frac{\rho _V}{M _V})$$
  - \rho interfacial tension
  - P_{chi} parachor of component i
  - M_L molecular weight of liquid phase
  - M_V molecular weight of gaseous phase
  - \rho_L liquid phase density
  - \rho_V vapour phase density
  - x_i mole fraction of component i in liquid phase
  - y_i mole fraction of component i in vapour phase
