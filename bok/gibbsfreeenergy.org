* Gibbs Free Energy

- represented by G
- capacity to do non-mechanical work

* Derivation

* Special Cases

$G(T,P,N) = NkT (c_p - ln(\frac{kT^{c_p}}{P \phi}))$

- G is Gibbs free energy
- S is entropy
- cp is heat capacity at constant pressure
- N is number of moles
- V is volume
- $\phi$ is a constant independent of the thermodynamic state if the gas, with the dimensions of $VTc_v/N$
- k is  = 1.381e-23 J/K
