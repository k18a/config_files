#+TITLE: Cauchy Schwarz Inequality
- the absolute value of the dot product of 2 non-zero vectors is always less than or equal to the product of the magnitueds of individual vectors
- the dot product is equal to the product of the magnitudes only when the vectors are linear - one of the vectors is a non-zero scalar multiple of the other
\begin{equation}
|[x].[y]| \leq ||x||.||y||
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
|[x].[y]| = ||x|| ||y|| \leftrightarrow [x] = c.[y]
\end{equation}
