#+TITLE: Exact Solution
* Exact Solutions
- start with a family of curves
  - $f\left( {x,y} \right) = c$
- differential equation is of the form
  - $df = 0$
  - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} dx + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} dy = 0$
- now let's begin with the differential equation
  - $M\left( {x,y} \right){dx} + N\left( {x,y} \right){dy} = 0$
- if there happens to exist a function
  - $f\left( {x,y} \right)$
- such that
  - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = M$
- and
  - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = N$
- then df can be written as
  - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}{dx} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}{dy} = 0$
  - $df = 0$
- general solution is
  - $f\left( {x,y} \right) = c$
- expression
  - $$M{dx} + N{dy}$$
  - is the exact differential equation
- the exact solution of a given fanction can sometimes be determined by inspection
  - curve example 1
    - $xy = 0$
    - $y{dx} + x{dy} = 0$
- curve example 2
  - $\frac{x}{y} = 0$
  - $\frac{1}{y}{dx} - \frac{x}{y^{2}}{dy} = 0$
* A test for exactness and a method to finding function f
- if a function f exists for a given exact differential equation
  - $M{dx} + N{dy} = 0$
- then the mixed second partial derivatives of f are equal assuming f is continuous
  - $\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial y\partial x} = \frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x\partial y}$
- this yields
  - $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$
  - to be a necessary condition for exactness
- to construct a function f that satisfies the given exact solution
- start by integrating
  - $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = M$
  - $f = \int M{dx} + g\left( y \right)$
- the integration constant is a function of y since it must disappear when differentiating with respect to Ã—
- our problem is now reduced to finding a function of y, g (y) such that f satisfies the equation
- $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = N$
- differentiating the last equation with respect to y
  - $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\int M{dx} + g^{1}\left( g \right) = N$
  - $g'\left( y \right) = N - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\int M{dx}$
  - $g\left( y \right) = \int\left( {N - \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\int M{dx}} \right){dy}$
- provided the integnand here is a function of y (derivative of the integnand with respect to x is o)
* Statement:
- an equation is exact if and only if
- $\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$
- the general solution is
- $f\left( {x,y} \right) = c$
