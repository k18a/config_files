#+TITLE: Closed Form Solution

- solves a given problem in terms of functions and mathematical operations from a given generally-accepted set
- infinte functions are not closed form solutions
- a function is said to be of closed form if it is contained in some so-called Liouvillian extension field of a field K - if they are obtained from rational functions
