#+TITLE: Seperable Equations

- differential equations that can be written in the form: 
- $\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)$
- the derivative is a product of two functions, each of which depends only on one of the variables 
- the variables are separated as follows
- $\frac{dy}{g(y)} = f(x)dx$
- this can be solved as
- $\int \frac{dy}{g(y)} = \int f(x)dx + c$
- the integrations themselves can be quite complicated to carry out sometimes
