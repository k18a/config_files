#+TITLE: Material Time Derivative
- describes the time rate of change of some physical quantity of a material element that is subjected to space and time dependent macroscopic velocity field variations of that physical quantity
- serves as a link between Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of continum deformation
- also known as total derivative, substantial derivative, or convective derivative

- consider two concepts with two different sets of co-ordinates
- for the sake of argument, let's define x at time t as, $x(t_0) = X$
** Lagrangian co-ordinates
- also known as refernce or material co-ordinates
- concentration measured at a point moving along the speed of a stream, c(X)
  - X with respect to fixed co-ordinates is not a function of time, as it's fixed
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt} (c(X,t)) = \frac{\partial c}{\partial t}
\end{equation}
** Eulerian co-ordinates
- also known as current or spatial co-rodinates
- concentration measured at a fixed point of a moving stream, c(x)
  - x with respect to fixed co-ordinates is a function of time, and hence written as x(t)
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt} (c(x(t),t)) = \frac{dc}{dt} 
= \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \frac {\partial c}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}
= \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + \nabla (c) . v
\end{equation}
- the first term represents the local rate of change - the rate of change in the absence of any flow
- the second term represents the convective rate of change - the convective derivative
- to sum up the material time derivative for any tensor field y that is macroscopic, with the sense that it depends only on position and time co-ordinates y=y(x,t):
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt} (y) = \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} + \nabla (y) * u
\end{equation}
- where \Nabla y is the covariant derivative
- u(x,t) is the flow velocity
