#+TITLE: Chemical Potential

* Chemical Potential

- a form of energy that can be absorbed or released during a chemical reaction or phase transition
- rate of change of free energy of a species in a mixture with respect to the change in the number of atoms or molecules of the species that are added to the system
- partial derivative of the free energy with respect to the amount of the species, with all other species' concentrations in the mixture remaining constant
- at equilibrium, the sum product of chemical potentials and stoichiometric coefficients of all species is 0, as the free energy approaches minimum
- particles tend to move from higher chemical potential to lower chemical potential

* Thermodynamic Formulation

Fundamental thermodynamic equation is given as: 

$dU = TdS - PdV + \sum \mu _i dn_i$

At constant entropy, volume, and number of moles of all species except species i

$\mu _i = (\frac{\partial U}{\partial N _i}) _{S, V, N _{j \ne i}}$

Similarly for other thermodynamic potentials

$\mu _i = (\frac{\partial G}{\partial N _i}) _{T, P, N _{j \ne i}}$

$\mu _i = (\frac{\partial H}{\partial N _i}) _{S, P, N _{j \ne i}}$

$\mu _i = (\frac{\partial F}{\partial N _i}) _{T, V, N _{j \ne i}}$
