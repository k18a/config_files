* Partial Differential Equations
- involves more than one independent variable, so that the derivatives occurring in it are partial derivatives

* Non Linear Differential Equations
** Conditions for linearity
- superposition principle: $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$
- homogeneity: $f(cx,cy)=c^kf(x,y)$
** Non-Linear Function
- a function in which the change of the output variable is not proportional to the change of the input
- non-linear functions are often approximated by linearization to allow them to be solved easily
- examples of non-linear differential equations include the [navierstokes](navierstokes) and [

* Numerical Solutions
** Introduction
- solving a complex PDE numerically requires systematic representation of the solution
  - define a computational domain and traiangulate into cells in 1D: intervals, 2D: triangles, 3D tetrahedra
  - cell size is the diameter of the cell
  - piecewise linear approximation of the function on the mesh - systematic representation - forms simple functions locally, pieced together into a complex function globally
- common mathematical models include
  - particle models - molecular dynamics
  - compartment models - chemical reactions
  - continuum models - mechanics of solids, liquids, and gases
  - statistical models
