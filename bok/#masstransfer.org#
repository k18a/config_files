#+TITLE: Mass Transfer

* Diffusion
  
- caused by brownian motion of particles
- approximate diffusion in
  - gases is 5 cm/min
  - liquids is 0.05 cm/min
  - solids is 0.00001 cm/min
- often the rate determining step in a series of physical processes

Diffusion may either be characterized using 

| rate constant                              | fick's laws                                             |
| lumped parameter model                     | distributed parameter model                             |
| $flux = k * \Delta(concentration)$         | $flux = D * (\frac{\Delta(concentration)}{length}$      |
| k is the mass transfer coefficient         | D is the diffusion coefficient                          |
| k is analogous to reciprocal of resistance | D is analogous to reciprocal of resistivity             |
| $voltage = resistance * current$           | $\frac{voltage}{length}= resistivity * current density$ |
| more empirical                             | more theoretical                                        |

- models used to fit experimental kinetic data often fail to consider if the boundary conditions assumed by the model are valid to the given experimental conditions cite:Qiu2009
