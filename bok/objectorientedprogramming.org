#+TITLE: Object Oriented Programming

- functions are not enough for larger pieces of code

* Injeritance 
- inherit features of base class to derived class
- derived class can use methods from base class
- methods can be over written if necessary as well


* Polymorphism
- way in which different objects of classes can share the same method name, and the methods can be called from the same place even though a variety of objects may be passed in

* Special Methods
- allows python inbuilt methods to be passed into classes

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def __str__(self):
    return value
#+END_SRC

the string representation of the class is used for inbuilt string function

* Modular Programming 

- emphasizes separating the functionality of a programme into independent, interchangeable modules
- each module contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality
