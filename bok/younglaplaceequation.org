#+TITLE: Young-Laplace Equation

- non-linear partial differential equation
- describes capillary pressure difference sustained across the interface between two static fluids due to the phenomenon of surface tension
- relates pressure difference to the shape of the surface or wall and is fundamental to the study of static capillary surfaces
  - static interface implies the absence of tangential stress - only normal stresses are considered
- a statement of normal stress balance for static fluids meeting at an interface, where the interface is treated as a surface with 0 thickness
  - $\Delta p = -\gamma \nabla . n$
    - \Delta p is the pressure difference accross the fluid interface
    - \gamma is the surface tension
    - n is the unit normal stress pointing out of the surface
  - $\Delta p = 2 . \gamma . H$
    - H is the mean curvature
  - $\Delta p = \gamma . (\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2})$
    - R1 and R2 are principle radii of curvature
