* Critical Desorption Pressure 

- CDP is the pressure at which gas will begin to desorb cite:Ross2007
- The difference in the amount adsorbed between the CDP and abandonment pressure gives the total producible sorbed gas cite:Ross2007
- Desorption efficiency is defined as the amount of sorbed methane produced for an unit drop in pressure - the first derivative of the desorption isotherm cite:Li2016a
