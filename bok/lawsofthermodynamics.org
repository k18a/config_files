* Laws of Thermodynamics

* Zeroth Law

* First Law

- \partial U = \partial Q + \partial W
- U is the [[file:internalenergy.org][internal energy]]
- \partial Q is the energy added as heat
- \partial W is the [[file:work.org][work done]]

* Second Law

- \partial Q = T dS 
- \partial Q is the energy added as heat
- T is the absolute temperature
- S is the [[file:entropy.org][entropy]]

Principle of Minimum Energy
- for a process with given constraints [[file:naturalvariables.org][natural variables]] and constant external parameters, 
  - at equilibrium the corresponding thermodynamic potential will approach a minimum
- can be compared with the principle of maximum entropy: 
  - for a closed system with fixed internal energy, the entropy tends to maximum at equilibrium

* Third Law
