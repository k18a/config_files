#+TITLE: Boundary Conditions

* Dirichlet 
- specification on the value of the solution itself on the boundary

* Neumann
- specification of the derivative of the solution on the boundary

* Cauchy 
- an ODE or a PDE that the solution must satisfy at the boundary
- specifies both the function value and the normal derivative on the boundary of the domain
- this corresponds to imposing both a Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions
